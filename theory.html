Figure 2.1: Three dimensions of representation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pitkin1967">Pitkin 1967</a>)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>The categories of representation shown in figure <a href="theory.html#fig:pitkin">2.1</a>, as
introduced by <span class="citation">Pitkin (<a href="#ref-pitkin1967">1967</a>)</span>, provide a structured approach to the
understanding of the different mechanisms by which representatives
fulfill their roles in a democratic setting. Descriptive representation
is primarily concerned with the numerical equivalence between
representatives and those they represent. The focus is on whether the
demographic and socio-political characteristics of the representative
body reflect those of the larger population. Pitkin’s notion of
substantive representation, on the other hand, emphasizes the political
influence of different social groups. It examines the extent to which
the legislative process is influenced and shaped by different segments
of society. In addition, Pitkin introduced symbolic representation, as
the role model that legislators can embody, serving as a symbol of
societal norms and values. This provides a useful framework for
analyzing whether and how this demographic is capable of promoting its
interests and sets the stage for my exploration of the substantive
representation of young voters, a demographic group that is
significantly influenced by political decisions, but whose political
influence remains largely unexplored. Our study intends to critically
interrogate the extent to which the demand for substantive
representation among the youth is met within the policy-making process.
By exploring this under-researched question, I aim to offer new insights
into the substantive representation of social groups, and in doing so,
contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics and potential
avenues for mitigating democratic deficits.</p>
<p>The relationship between different types of representation is not
straightforward and often depends on various socio-political factors.
<span class="citation">Mansbridge (<a href="#ref-mansbridge1999">1999</a>)</span> elaborates on the crucial link between descriptive and
substantive representation, that descriptive representation assumes
heightened importance in contexts where a social group has
<em>uncrystallized</em> substantive interests. These interests are defined as
those that are still emerging, under-articulated, or under-included in
policy debates. Mansbridge argues persuasively that, in such scenarios,
the presence of group members in legislative assemblies can promote more
robust deliberation and recognition of these interests, thereby
enhancing substantive representation. Recent scholarship has made a
compelling case that the youth population is an example of a social
group with <em>uncrystallized</em> substantive interests <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-munger2022">Munger 2022</a>)</span>. This
thesis is based on the demonstrable difference between the political
preferences of young people and those of older citizens, as well as the
absence of young adults in political assemblies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stockemer2018">Stockemer and Sundström 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, public opinion and government policy can be understood as
reciprocal interconnected, creating a cycle of influence that is
critical to the functioning of representative democracy <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wlezien2016">Wlezien and Soroka 2016</a>)</span>.
The links that connect this cycle are citizens’ preferences, their
voting choices, the selection of policymakers, and the making of the
policy itself <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-powell2004">G. B. Powell 2004</a>)</span>, which then feeds back to preferences. This
chain has been shown to be exposed by numerous factors, most notably
elections <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stimson1995">Stimson, Mackuen, and Erikson 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-hobolt2005">Hobolt and Klemmemsen 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-jacobs2000">L. R. Jacobs and Shapiro 2000</a>)</span> and electoral systems
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hobolt2005">Hobolt and Klemmemsen 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-hobolt2008">Binzer Hobolt and Klemmensen 2007</a>)</span>; issue salience <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-burstein2003">Burstein 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-elkjaer2020">Elkjær and Iversen 2020</a>)</span>
and interest groups <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baumgartner2009">Baumgartner et al. 2009</a>)</span>. Thus, this dynamic model of
representation underscores a critical element in political processes -
the adaptive relationship between public opinion and policy. Central to
this perspective is the premise that political actors respond
strategically to changing public preferences in order to maintain or
enhance their electoral viability and that voters seek to maximize their
own utility when voting <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-downs1957">Downs 1957</a>)</span>. The key driving force is the need
to secure electoral support, reflecting the vote-seeking nature of
political conflict <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-strom1990">Strøm 1990</a>; <a href="#ref-muller1999">Müller and Strøm 1999</a>)</span>. Existing literature has
shown that younger demographic groups remain politically disengaged, as
evidenced by a decline in conventional participation, particularly in
voting and in joining key institutions such as political parties
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-milner2010">Milner 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-goerres2009">Goerres 2009</a>)</span>. This interpretation expects a lack of
representation towards young adults as policymakers have no tangible
(electoral) benefits from responding to their interests <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lupia2005">Lupia and Philpot 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-dermody2010">Dermody, Hanmer-Lloyd, and Scullion 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-pruitt2017">Pruitt 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-raby2017">Raby et al. 2017</a>)</span>. For a better understanding of the
mechanics, I need to discuss what I define as <em>representation of
substantive interests</em>.</p>
<p>The substantive dimension of representation involves the actions,
decisions, and behavior of the representative, as opposed to descriptive
representation, which primarily emphasizes the extent to which
representatives mirror or describe their constituents in terms of shared
demographic. As I explore the complex dynamics of youth representation,
responsiveness, and congruence are two concepts often posited as
integral to substantive representation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wlezien2016">Wlezien and Soroka 2016</a>)</span>. Responsiveness
refers to how closely a representative’s behavior matches the
preferences of his or her constituents <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dahl1971">Dahl 1971</a>)</span>, which is typically
measured by comparing either government policies or actors’ positions
with public opinion <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-budge2001">Budge 2001</a>; <a href="#ref-hobolt2008">Binzer Hobolt and Klemmensen 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-ezrow2010">Ezrow 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-wlezien2017">Wlezien 2016</a>)</span>.
Congruence, on the other hand, emphasizes a match between the policy
preferences of voters and the voting behavior or policy stance of their
representatives <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-powell2009">G. Powell 2009</a>)</span>. High congruence implies a strong match
between public preferences and political action <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-boas2019">Boas and Smith 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-helliesen2022">Helliesen 2022</a>)</span>. However, it is important to note that neither is a
simple indicator of substantive representation, as constituents may not
always know what is best for them or may not be able to express their
preferences effectively due to systemic biases <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wittman1995">Wittman 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-caplan2008">Caplan 2008</a>)</span>. On the other hand, representatives may want to take into
account the interests of their constituents but may not be fully
informed about how to do so <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lupia1998">Lupia and McCubbins 1998</a>; <a href="#ref-jones2005">Jones and Baumgartner 2005</a>)</span>. By its very
nature, responsiveness respects the dynamism of policy preferences,
whereas congruence assumes a degree of stability in policy preferences
that may not always exist <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baumgartner1993">Baumgartner and Jones 1993</a>)</span>. While this assumption is
useful in many contexts that examine a single, specific point in time,
it cannot adequately capture this dynamism. The group of young adults
constantly changes its preferences as people age and because of the
fluidity of young voters’ political preferences and their exposure to
rapid societal change <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jennings1975">Jennings and Niemi 1975</a>)</span>. This makes responsiveness a more
appropriate concept for explaining the substantive representation of
each age group independently, which is a critical aspect of relational
equality. As <span class="citation">Dahl (<a href="#ref-dahl1971">1971</a>)</span> states “a key characteristic of democracy is the
continued responsiveness of the government to the preferences of the
people”. This happens when the democratic process leads the government
to formulate and implement policies that the citizens want.</p>
<div id="drivers-of-responsiveness" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Drivers of Responsiveness<a href="theory.html#drivers-of-responsiveness" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Two dominant theoretical paradigms have been proposed to explain
policymakers’ tendency to be responsive: (1) the conceptual model of
group interest representation, and (2) the electoral paradigm, which
emphasizes the vote-seeking tendencies inherent in political conflict.
The theory of group interest representation posits that the behavior of
legislators is significantly shaped by their personal preferences and
individual backgrounds <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-miller1963">Miller and Stokes 1963</a>; <a href="#ref-burden2007">Burden 2007</a>)</span>. It postulates that
intrinsic motivations, modulated by personal background and preferences,
are the primary determinants of political action. This inference is
supported by claims that legislators are naturally inclined to align
with and advocate for demographic groups that are similar to their own,
due to shared personal preferences or an affinity created by group
identification <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mansbridge1999">Mansbridge 1999</a>, <a href="#ref-mansbridge2003">2003</a>)</span>. Legislators’
identification with particular demographic or social groups could
significantly moderate their political behavior. For example,
legislators who identify with a racial or ethnic minority may be
predisposed to propose policies that favor their particular group
because of a common identity or shared experiences. Life experiences
also play a key role in shaping a legislator’s perspectives and
priorities. For example, a legislator who has experienced poverty or who
has worked extensively with impoverished communities may be more
inclined to prioritize and support anti-poverty policies. Individual
ideologies and personal values can also guide the political actions of
legislators and influence their stance on different issues. An
environmentally conscious legislator may be more inclined to support and
propose policies that promote environmental protection, regardless of
the political consequences or prevailing public opinion. Similarly,
deeply held ideological beliefs can guide policy preferences and voting
behavior. For example, legislators with a libertarian ideological
orientation might favor policies that limit government intervention,
while those with a socialist orientation might favor policies that
promote government involvement in economic affairs. Empirical literature
examining the relationship between politicians’ characteristics, such as
gender, race, income class, and sexual orientation, and their propensity
to advocate for groups with similar characteristics suggests a robust
relationship. Evidence suggests that legislators are more responsive to
the interests and preferences of demographic groups that share their
personal characteristics <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-whitby1997">Whitby 1997</a>; <a href="#ref-tate2003">Tate 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-burden2007">Burden 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-carnes2012">Carnes 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-franck2012">Franck and Rainer 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-broockman2013">Broockman 2013</a>)</span>, and this correlation has been
extended to policy outcomes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chattopadhyay2004">Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-preuhs2006">Preuhs 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-funk2018">Funk and Philips 2018</a>)</span>. It should be noted, however, that these relationships are
not uncontested <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ferreira2014">Ferreira and Gyourko 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-butler2011">Butler and Broockman 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-elkjaer2021">Elkjær and Klitgaard 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Another perspective on political representation, referred to as the
dynamic representation model <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stimson1995">Stimson, Mackuen, and Erikson 1995</a>)</span> (see the thermostatic model
by <span class="citation">Wlezien (<a href="#ref-wlezien1995">1995</a>)</span> for a similar approach), emphasizes the ongoing,
responsive relationship between shifts in public opinion and changes in
policy. This conceptualization, often contrasted with static models of
representation, asserts that policy does not simply reflect public
opinion at a single point in time, but rather its constant evolution.
The core idea of dynamic representation hinges on the temporal factor,
illustrating a continuous interaction between public preferences and
policy adjustments. Dynamic representation models suggest that political
parties, in their quest to maintain electoral relevance, could
strategically advance the interests of their electoral base to a greater
extent. In support of this argument, it has been observed that
politicians from certain racial groups may predominantly promote the
interests of their racial constituents, particularly if they perceive
winning support from other racial groups as more challenging
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-grose2011">Grose 2011</a>)</span>. The critical drivers here are the impact of upcoming
elections on policy decisions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hobolt2005">Hobolt and Klemmemsen 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-wlezien2016">Wlezien and Soroka 2016</a>)</span>, just as the
policies enacted also shape public opinion <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-soroka2009">Soroka and Wlezien 2009</a>)</span>. Thus, a cycle
of influence between public opinion and public policy is critical to the
functioning of representative democracy. The assumptions that are made
in this view are twofold. First voters can place all election
alternatives along a political spectrum and choose the alternative
closest to their own point of view <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-downs1957">Downs 1957</a>; <a href="#ref-powell2004">G. B. Powell 2004</a>)</span>. Secondly,
<span class="citation">Downs (<a href="#ref-downs1957">1957</a>)</span> median voter theorem states that candidates rationally choose
a point that maximizes their share of the vote and that the limited
number of electoral choices (Downs initially studied the American
two-party system) leads to an equal election outcome if both take the
policy positions of the median voter. In this way, citizens maximize the
utility of their votes and ensure that their preferences are reflected
in the political process. These theories have subsequently been extended
to include more candidates <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-palfrey1984">Palfrey 1984</a>)</span> and in multidimensional
political spaces <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-davis1970">Davis, Hinich, and Ordeshook 1970</a>)</span>. Central to this perspective, however,
remains that elected representatives and parties are constantly faced
with decisions about how to position themselves in the midst of these
conflicting viewpoints. In order to be re-elected, politicians must
maximize their votes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-strom1990">Strøm 1990</a>; <a href="#ref-muller1999">Müller and Strøm 1999</a>)</span> and align these positions
with the preferences of the largest possible number of voters, usually
the median voter. As such, they change their political positions
dynamically <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stimson1995">Stimson, Mackuen, and Erikson 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-wlezien1995">Wlezien 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-hobolt2008">Binzer Hobolt and Klemmensen 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Traditionally, these dimensions have been studied separately. However,
both these theories yield predictions fully consistent with scholars’
findings; indeed, they typically yield the same predictions. The dynamic
model of representation thus emphasizes a critical element in political
processes - the adaptive and evolving relationship between public
opinion and policy. Central to this perspective is the premise that
political actors respond strategically to changing public preferences in
order to maintain or enhance their electoral viability. Group interest
representation, on the other hand, emphasizes legislators’
identification with particular demographic or social groups. Because
they share similar experiences and beliefs, they will ultimately
consider the same positions important and act accordingly. Therefore,
consistent with both theories, I expect that</p>
<div class="hypothesis">
<p><span id="hyp:H1" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.1  </strong></span>Policymakers will be responsive to the median voter’s spending
preferences</p>
</div>
<p>Having established the conceptual foundations of the dynamic model of
representation and intrinsic group representation, the next step is to
place these theories in the context of youth representation. The two
theories have often made similar predictions, and both are supported by
empirical evidence. However, as I attempt to disentangle the different
preferences of young adults and how legislatures respond to them, I need
to ask: what are the primary drivers of policymakers’ responsive
behavior? The lack of research on responsiveness to different age groups
represents a research gap with the potential for impactful insights. Age
is an easily identifiable demographic characteristic that policymakers
can immediately recognize and respond to, highlighting its importance in
their policy choices. Consequently, the divergence in policy preferences
between younger and older demographic groups may reflect potential
differences in policymakers’ responsiveness to these cohorts, thereby
contributing to a deeper understanding of the theoretical models under
scrutiny. Answering this question requires a more detailed
investigation. The approach I take here has two key elements. First, I
discuss the theoretical expectations of differential responsiveness to
youth. Second, I suggest that the crucial determinants of policy
responsiveness vary according to the specificity of the issues involved.</p>

<p>Given that young representatives should care about similar issues and
best understand the demands of young voters, it seems obvious at first
glance that increasing descriptive representation will lead to better
representation of their interests. Indeed, there is empirical research
that suggests that young politicians exhibit behaviors that distinguish
them from their older counterparts. <span class="citation">Alesina, Cassidy, and Troiano (<a href="#ref-alesina2018">2018</a>)</span> show that in the
absence of term limits, younger mayors are more likely to engage in
political budget cycles, perhaps reflecting their heightened career
concerns and longer political horizons. While <span class="citation">Kissau, Lutz, and Rosset (<a href="#ref-kissau2012">2012</a>)</span> find that the
policy preferences of different age groups are relatively equally
represented in the lower house of the Swiss parliament, the median
preferences of citizens aged 21-30 are further away from the median
legislator than those aged 51-60. A study by <span class="citation">C. T. McClean (<a href="#ref-mcclean2021">2021</a>)</span> provides some
direct empirical evidence suggesting that Japanese mayors under the age
of 50 increase spending on child welfare, ostensibly due to personal
experience and longer time horizons rather than superior responsiveness
to younger voters. <span class="citation">Mansbridge (<a href="#ref-mansbridge2003">2003</a>)</span> contention of uncrystallized
substantive interests provides a useful framework to explain the group
representation of young adults.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the criteria for under-representation are met when a group
(1) lacks adequate descriptive representation, (2) has distinct
preferences, and (3) finds these preferences not fully deliberated in
the policy-making process. While under-representation in political
assemblies is a numerical fact <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-IPU2016">Union 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-stockemer2018">Stockemer and Sundström 2018</a>)</span>, the shifting
preferences of young adults have a long tradition in political science.
One possible framework for explaining age-related differences in
attitudes has been developed by Ronald Inglehart, who posits a shift in
societal values away from material needs and towards self-expression,
quality of life, and equality as societies become more affluent and
secure <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-inglehart1977">Inglehart 1977</a>, <a href="#ref-inglehart1990">1990</a>)</span>. This is being driven by an
increase in higher-status jobs and as more cohorts grow up in relative
prosperity, replacing generations of economic poverty <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-inglehart1986">Inglehart and Rabier 1986</a>; <a href="#ref-inglehart2000">Inglehart 2000</a>)</span>. Younger Generations, for example, appear to be more
pluralistic, multicultural, and egalitarian in their beliefs
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-abramson1995">Abramson and Inglehart 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-busemeyer2009">Busemeyer, Goerres, and Weschle 2009</a>)</span>. Older generations, on the other hand,
tend to be more conservative. They support greater military spending and
oppose policies aimed at reducing income inequality in the US
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wattenberg2020">Wattenberg 2020</a>)</span>. These intergenerational differences have also been
shown to influence party preferences in European democracies
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-walczak2012">Walczak, van der Brug, and de Vries 2012</a>)</span>, with each successive generation showing a greater
propensity to support Green parties, whose ideologies reflect
quality-of-life values more than other left-wing parties
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kitschelt1988">Kitschelt 1988</a>; <a href="#ref-lichtin2023">Lichtin, van der Brug, and Rekker 2023</a>)</span>. It is important to distinguish
generational and period effects from age effects. To help understand
these differences, some researchers have examined age-related factors.
Several studies have found inconsistent results regarding the alleged
shift towards conservative views with age when controlling for
generations and periods <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tilley2014">Tilley and Evans 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-peterson2020">Peterson, Smith, and Hibbing 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-geys2022">Geys, Heggedal, and Sørensen 2022</a>)</span>.
However, since my primary research question is how legislators respond
to these differences, I will not further disaggregate these
factors.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In line with much of the research, I expect two
main factors to drive the different preferences of younger citizens.
First, younger generations are more likely to have more egalitarian and
quality-of-life beliefs, and this is independent of point in time, as
this is a persistent shift that holds true for each subsequent
generation. Second, I expect preferences to be biased by the basic
motivation of self-interest <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bowles2000">Bowles, Gintis, et al. 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-fong2001">Fong 2001</a>)</span>. When voters have
to choose between different policies or allocate resources to different
areas, they will be more generous if they personally benefit from them.</p>
<p>Mansbridge’s third claim is that <em>uncrystallized</em> substantive interests
are not fully deliberated in policy-making. This could indeed be not the
case, despite low descriptive representation. Politicians are embedded
in societal structures that involve inter-generational interactions
which leads to more direct contact between groups. These interactions,
combined with more personal connections between younger and older
generations, such as family ties, can significantly influence
legislative decisions. As a result, it could be argued that, in the case
of age groups, not only are the preferences of young adults well known
to older members of parliament, but they also have an interest in and
are better placed to consider, those preferences not in their own
interests, but in the interests of their children. However, this
argument undervalues the cruciality of shared experiences and beliefs
for group representation. Even if older MPs believe they act in the
interest of the younger citizens, they will never fully understand what
those interests are. Additionally, I argue that if shared
characteristics are the main driver of substantive representation, the
majority of older policymakers are not willing to defend the interests
of young citizens. That is cause the generational shift from material to
immaterial values is not only reflected in different preferences but
also in a shift from distributive to relational equality, meaning older
generations will stronger favor the view that young citizens do not need
substantive representation as they will be better represented (mainly in
terms of material values) when they get older. Achieving equal
representation for young adults, therefore, depends on a conscious
deliberation that emphasizes relational equality between age groups,
which can best be done by young representatives.</p>
<p>An additional factor that can translate a group’s descriptive
representation into substantive representation is the presence of
critical actors, a concept developed to understand the impact of women
in politics. As explained by <span class="citation">Childs and Krook (<a href="#ref-childs2009">2009</a>)</span>, critical actors catalyze
policy development and stimulate advocacy for group policies, regardless
of the numerical strength of the group they represent. This
understanding emphasizes the importance of shared group solidarity and
proactive efforts to consolidate this solidarity. It highlights the
unique characteristic of critical actors, their deep commitment to group
interests, and their conceptualization of representation in collective
rather than individual terms. In addition, their potential to act as
critical actors are enhanced by their rich political experience and
their occupation of influential institutional roles such as committee
chairs <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-grey2006">Grey 2006</a>)</span>. Following the theories of <em>politics of presence</em> and
<em>critical mass</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-celis2008">Celis 2008</a>)</span>, much research has identified women,
feminists, and left-wing parties as the main champions of women’s issues
in legislative assemblies.</p>
<p>However, recent research also highlights the knowledge gaps regarding
non-group actors such as men <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-celis2006">Celis 2006</a>)</span> and conservative parties
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-childs2012">Childs and Webb 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-wiliarty2010">Wiliarty 2010</a>)</span> in advocating for women’s interests. These
non-group actors typically do not rally around group demands and thus do
not advance group agendas, as understood from the <em>advocacy</em> perspective
of parliamentary representation. These theories emphasize lived
experiences, awareness of issues, and alliances with organizations as
factors that enhance their advocacy. However, the concept of
representation could also be reformulated as <em>representation by
deliberation</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-celis2013">Celis and Erzeel 2013</a>)</span>. In this model, a group’s interests are fluid
rather than predefined and subject to ongoing political discourse.
Critical actors are therefore <em>deliberators</em> rather than <em>critical
actors</em>, contributing to dialogue and increasing responsiveness by
introducing divergent and contradictory viewpoints. Focusing on the case
of youth representation, systemic structures that favor existing age
demographics <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-joshi2013">Joshi 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-stockemer2018">Stockemer and Sundström 2018</a>)</span> and perceptions that younger
voters are not suitable for office <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mansbridge1999">Mansbridge 1999</a>)</span> may hinder the rise
of young representatives to the status of critical actors, limiting
their ability to exert significant influence on policy-making and these
fostering political disengagement. The critical difference to dynamic
representation here is that the initial cause of this loop is the lack
of representatives who reflect the interests of young voters in elected
assemblies by virtue of their common age. <span class="citation">Hájek (<a href="#ref-hájek2019">2019</a>)</span> argues that the age
of legislators positively influences their parliamentary activity and
voting, while longer tenure shows the opposite effect. Older and more
experienced legislators propose more bills, make more speeches, and have
higher rates of acquiring presidential posts. Therefore, even if the
descriptive representation of young adults is achieved, their ability to
significantly influence policy may be inhibited. But even if the
opportunities to achieve influential positions are limited, older
representatives cannot fulfill this need because they are not expected
to understand the preferences properly. Only young representatives can
act as critical actors, not by taking critical positions, but by
deliberating on the interests of their contemporaries. In line with the
large literature on politicians’ gender, race, (income) class, and
sexual orientation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schwindt-bayer2006">Schwindt-Bayer 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-burden2007">Burden 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-franck2012">Franck and Rainer 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-reynolds2013">Reynolds 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-broockman2013">Broockman 2013</a>)</span> I expect that shared experiences and
identities between young voters and their representatives will
strengthen the link between descriptive and substantive representation,
and consequently increase the responsiveness of policy outcomes.</p>

<p><span class="citation">Bailer et al. (<a href="#ref-bailer2021a">2021</a>)</span> find that merely sharing descriptive characteristics with a
particular group does not necessarily translate into representing that
group’s interests. MPs, particularly those representing younger
demographic groups, tend to strategically prioritize their legislative
activities, initially aligning themselves with their group’s interests
in the early stages of their careers, ostensibly to establish
credibility and expertise. Later in their careers, there is an apparent
shift to other legislative efforts. The implications of these findings
extend into the realm of political alienation. When legislators do not
act in the interest of their constituents this enforces low levels of
descriptive representation - either as a direct result or mediated
through institutional constraints - and catalyzes the feedback loop of
political alienation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mcclean2020b">C. McClean and Ono 2020b</a>)</span>. Younger demographic groups remain
politically disengaged <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lawless2015">Lawless and Fox 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-shames2017">Shames 2017</a>)</span> and show disinterest
in conventional political participation, especially in voting and
joining political parties <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-milner2010">Milner 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-goerres2009">Goerres 2009</a>)</span>. However, the
explanation of this limited political engagement as apathy
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dermody2010">Dermody, Hanmer-Lloyd, and Scullion 2010</a>)</span> has been contested. A lack of political engagement may
not simply signify apathy, but rather a sense of alienation created by a
political system that is biased against the young and discourages their
participation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lupia2005">Lupia and Philpot 2005</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Drawing on the work of <span class="citation">Inglehart (<a href="#ref-inglehart1977">1977</a>)</span>, it is suggested that there is a
noticeable shift in young adults’ values from material needs to ideals
such as self-expression, quality of life, and equality as societies
achieve greater affluence and security. This shift in values not only
represents a difference in content but also reveals a different temporal
perspective, which is a critical factor in understanding dynamic
representation. In addition, the interests of young adults tend to be
more oriented towards long-term decisions, due to the greater span of
their potential future lives. This is underlined by the fact that
younger Japanese mayors take a longer time horizon into account when
making decisions. This inevitably means that they will be more deeply
affected by the outcomes of such decisions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mcclean2021">C. T. McClean 2021</a>)</span>. However, the
dynamic nature of electoral politics <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-downs1957">Downs 1957</a>; <a href="#ref-stimson1995">Stimson, Mackuen, and Erikson 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-hobolt2005">Hobolt and Klemmemsen 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-wlezien2016">Wlezien and Soroka 2016</a>)</span> and the constant need to appeal to voters
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-strom1990">Strøm 1990</a>; <a href="#ref-muller1999">Müller and Strøm 1999</a>)</span> may lead politicians to focus on issues with
immediate or short-term policy outcomes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-arnold1990">Arnold 1990</a>; <a href="#ref-jacobs2016">Alan M. Jacobs 2016</a>)</span>.
These immediate policy outcomes can be effectively communicated and made
visible in a short period of time, making it easier for politicians to
showcase their achievements before the next election cycle begins. The
recurrent lack of responsiveness of the political process to policies
with potential long-term benefits, therefore, culminates in a sense of
alienation among young voters. The cause of the alienation of young
voters from the political process is understood here as a function of
the incongruence between the long-term orientation of young people and
the short-term orientation of political entities. However, this
disengagement depends on young voters’ perceptions that their political
preferences and interests are not adequately represented. Therefore,
while descriptive representation may have symbolic value and enhance the
legitimacy of democratic institutions in the eyes of young voters
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-norris1994">Norris and Lovenduski 1994</a>)</span>, I argue, in line with <span class="citation">Pruitt (<a href="#ref-pruitt2017">2017</a>)</span> formulation, that
“while young people continue to create informal, individualized
strategies to deal with issues they care about, many still want formal
political leaders to listen to and address their concerns”. As
politicians are constantly having to secure future electoral outcomes,
they are unable to meet this demand if young adults refrain from voting.
In terms of party recruitment strategies for political office, low youth
voter turnout also affects parties as they have less incentive to
nominate younger candidates <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-norris1993">Norris and Lovenduski 1993</a>; <a href="#ref-parijs1998">Parijs 1998</a>; <a href="#ref-berz2022">Berz and Jankowski 2022</a>)</span>.
<span class="citation">Delli Carpini (<a href="#ref-dellicarpini2000">2000</a>)</span> argued it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[M]ost of the formal institutions of public life either ignore young
adults and the issues that matter to them or are ill equipped to
attract young adults and provide them with meaningful opportunities to
participate. Parties and candidates see little reason to devote their
resources to reaching out to young Americans given that this age
cohort is less likely to vote than older Americans. Government
officials are unlikely to listen to young Americans, knowing there is
little risk that they will be punished for their neglect at the polls.
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dellicarpini2000">Delli Carpini 2000</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This second crucial mechanism of dynamic representation thus could
become a critical catalyst of alienation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mcclean2020b">C. McClean and Ono 2020b</a>)</span>. Analyzing this
under-representation also requires consideration of voting behavior.
Indeed, a meta-analysis by <span class="citation">Eshima and Smith (<a href="#ref-eshima2022">2022</a>)</span> suggests that voters show a
strong preference for younger political candidates, regardless of the
voter’s age, which <span class="citation">C. T. McClean and Ono (<a href="#ref-mcclean2022">2022</a>)</span> confirms in an experimental setting.
This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that voters are not
inclined to elect young leaders and turns the focus back to the
political participation of young adults. This argument is valid as long
as policymakers do not derive tangible benefits from engaging young
adults. This is underlined by findings that show young adults are highly
engagement in new political forms <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pruitt2017">Pruitt 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-raby2017">Raby et al. 2017</a>)</span>, like civil
movements <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-binder2020">Binder et al. 2020</a>)</span> and in issue-driven elections <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sloam2018">Sloam 2018</a>)</span>, when
they perceive an issue as relevant. These findings suggest that the lack
of responsiveness to young adults is not as deeply rooted as group
representation theory would suggest, but rather a by-product of a
political system that has yet to adapt to emerging values and
expectations. Young people can provide both electoral support and
resources to policymakers regardless of adequate descriptive
representation, as long as they respond to their preferred forms of
political expression, particularly interest group mobilization. While
the emphasis on long-term preferences remains a systemic shortcoming,
the dynamics of representation should theoretically allow for the
adaptation and harnessing of young adults’ demand for representation.
For example, according to the thermostatic model of representation
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wlezien1995">Wlezien 1995</a>)</span>, the incentive to respond to these demands should
increase in proportion to the degree of deviation from their
preferences. Consequently, with increased responsiveness, the downward
trend in political participation could be reversed <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sjoberg2015">Sjoberg, Mellon, and Peixoto 2015</a>)</span>,
ultimately providing policymakers with electoral incentives to
demonstrate responsiveness to the demands of young voters. Nevertheless,
political participation remains a crucial determinant in shaping the
supply side of conventional political processes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-norris1993">Norris and Lovenduski 1993</a>; <a href="#ref-lawless2015">Lawless and Fox 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-shames2017">Shames 2017</a>)</span>, as it provides little incentive to respond
to their interests. While this could potentially be mitigated by
adapting positions relevant to young adults, I don’t expect this to make
a big difference. In addition with the consequent under-representation
of young adults in OECD countries <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stockemer2018">Stockemer and Sundström 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-stockemer2022">Stockemer and Sundstrom 2022</a>)</span>, I
expect</p>
<div class="hypothesis">
<p><span id="hyp:H2" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.2  </strong></span>Policymakers to be less responsive to young adults than to the median
voter, i.e. young adults’ preferences will have a weaker impact on
policy outcomes.</p>
</div>
<p>While the potential drivers discussed agree on the importance of
representing young adults, they differ fundamentally on the factors that
contribute to the levels of responsiveness to young adults. While
dynamic representation sees the problem as a more fluid process in which
young adults’ patterns of engagement and the adaptability of the
political system play an important role, group representation frames it
as a structural one rooted in generational differences and the
inadequacy of shared experiences in the existing political structure.
Examining responsiveness across different issue areas can provide a more
nuanced understanding of the drivers of political representation and
responsiveness to different age groups, and thereby help clarify which
theory offers a more comprehensive account of the key drivers.</p>
</div>
<div id="responsiveness-issue-areas" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Responsiveness &amp; issue areas<a href="theory.html#responsiveness-issue-areas" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>It is widely acknowledged in the literature that different issue areas
might involve different levels of knowledge, interest, and stake for
different age groups. Young adults, for instance, might show higher
interest and involvement in issues related to education, digital policy,
or climate change <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-abramson1995">Abramson and Inglehart 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-kitschelt1988">Kitschelt 1988</a>; <a href="#ref-lichtin2023">Lichtin, van der Brug, and Rekker 2023</a>)</span>, while
older generations might be more concerned with healthcare, pensions, or
taxes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sihvo1995">Sihvo and Uusitalo 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-goerres2009">Goerres 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-naumann2017">Naumann 2017</a>)</span>. This variation can
influence the responsiveness of policymakers towards the median voter
(<span class="math inline">\(R_m\)</span>) and young voters (<span class="math inline">\(R_y\)</span>), as they might be more inclined to
respond to demands or preferences that are more salient among their
constituents. By looking at different issue areas, it is possible to
evaluate whether the lower responsiveness to young adults observed in
some contexts is a systemic feature (as suggested by group
representation theory) or a consequence of political dynamics (as
suggested by the model of dynamic representation). Understanding the
nature of the issues allows us to consider the circumstances in which
the representation of particular group interests outweighs the electoral
interests.</p>
<p>To facilitate this examination, I have categorized policy issues
according to their relevance to young adults. Categories are: (<span class="math inline">\(r_y\)</span>)
relevant for younger voters, (<span class="math inline">\(r_m\)</span>) relevant for median voters. This
segmentation recognizes that policy issues often resonate differently
across age groups due to the different needs, preferences, and lived
experiences associated with different stages of life <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-inglehart1977">Inglehart 1977</a>; <a href="#ref-munger2022">Munger 2022</a>)</span> see discussion above] The first category (<span class="math inline">\(r_y\)</span>), youth
relevance, covers policy issues that predominantly affect younger
demographic groups. For example, education policy, access to the labor
market, affordable housing, student loan schemes, and certain aspects of
digital or environmental policy fall into this category. Politicians are
expected to be generally less responsive in these areas because they are
not important to their groups (<span class="math inline">\(R_m(r_y) &lt; R_m(r_m)\)</span>). However as these
issues are of particular value to the limited number of young
representatives, I expect policy-making in these cases to be more
responsive to young people (<span class="math inline">\(R_y(r_y) &gt; R_y(r_m)\)</span>). The second category
(<span class="math inline">\(r_m\)</span>), median voters relevance, refers to policy issues in which
younger adults have no particular interest. Rather I expect these to be
relevant for the median voter. As conventional political participation
is low among the youth, this reflects disproportionately the older
population. It includes policy areas that affect all age groups, with no
particular emphasis on younger or older populations and those that
reflect the specific needs and experiences of the elderly. These could
be issues that affect the collective, such as general tax policy,
national security, foreign policy or infrastructure development or
pension systems, retirement policies, and health care for the elderly.
In addition, some of these issues may be characterized by a high degree
of complexity and interdependence with multiple national and
international actors, effectively limiting the scope for policymakers to
respond to a specific group. Given that the majority of parliamentary
assemblies tend to represent older citizens, I expect these areas to be
characterized by high overall responsiveness (<span class="math inline">\(R_m(r_m) &gt; R_m(r_y)\)</span>) and
a particularly strong link to the preferences of older people, leading
to lower responsiveness to young adults (<span class="math inline">\(R_y(r_m) &lt; R_y(r_y)\)</span>).</p>
<p>To adopt a comprehensive methodology, I introduce an additional temporal
aspect, primarily dictated by the quest for electoral support. This
aspect divides the political landscape into (<span class="math inline">\(i_s\)</span>) short-term
influential and (<span class="math inline">\(i_l\)</span>) long-term influential issues. That elections,
whilst providing a crucial safeguard of accountability, can also
introduce short-term bias has a long history in political science and
economics <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fisher1930">Fisher 1930</a>; <a href="#ref-solow1956">Solow 1956</a>; <a href="#ref-nordhaus1975">Nordhaus 1975</a>; <a href="#ref-arnold1990">Arnold 1990</a>)</span>.
<span class="citation">Alan M. Jacobs (<a href="#ref-jacobs2016">2016</a>)</span> more recently argued that politicians’ myopia can be
attributed to the desire for policies to deliver quick and visible
results, which serve the dual purpose of demonstrating their
effectiveness and increasing their electoral appeal. The pressing
concerns and interests of the electorate are reflected in these
immediate policy outcomes, creating a strong link between the electorate
and their representatives. The information constraints and cognitive
biases faced by voters play a crucial role in this process. Voters are
more likely to be attracted to the immediate and tangible effects of
policy outcomes, as these are easier for them to understand and
appreciate. This, in turn, creates a strong sense of connection and
affirmation towards the actions of representatives, ensuring that these
actions are correctly identified as responsiveness by the electorate.
Politicians, aware of this dynamic, are incentivized to design and
implement policies that produce visible results within their term of
office. Such a strategy is a means of securing public support and
maintaining their political standing. The concept of <em>hyperbolic
discounting</em>, defined as the tendency to prioritize immediate, smaller
benefits over larger, future ones, is also relevant in this context.
This cognitive bias pervades the individual decision-making process, but
it also extends to collective policy preferences, leading voters to
support policies that offer immediate gratification. Public mistrust in
the ability of governments to deliver on long-term commitments can
further reinforce skepticism about such policies. Nevertheless, a
single-minded focus on immediate benefits can inadvertently fuel
organized opposition to policies that offer future benefits. Policies
whose costs are immediate but whose benefits are deferred provide an
opportunity for interest groups to mobilize opposition. This dynamic
complicates the policy-making process and discourages investment in
long-term initiatives <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jacobs2011">Alan M. Jacobs 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-jacobs2016">Alan M. Jacobs 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, there is a significant contradiction in the practical
application of this concept. Scholars often categorize an entire issue
domain as either short or long-term <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bonfiglioli2013">Bonfiglioli and Gancia 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-bonoli2016">Bonoli and Trein 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-schulze2021">Schulze 2021</a>)</span>, a practice that deviates from the theory’s original focus
on preferences for particular policy instruments. In the case of welfare
state policy, for example, the choice of instrument tends to confront
policymakers not with the nature of the policy to be reformed, but with
the decision to balance immediate costs and the time frame for potential
payoffs. This inconsistency may be one reason for the mixed results of
research on temporal bias in policy-making. While studies of specific
policy areas (such as welfare state reform) often find evidence of
short-term bias, this tendency is less clear when research focuses on
resource allocation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dahlberg1998">Dahlberg and Lindström 1998</a>)</span>. However, the primary aim of this
research is not to identify systemic factors that may exacerbate
short-term biases but rather to shed light on the differences in
spending patterns across different policy areas. The main interest is in
how these policy areas are uniquely affected by temporal dilemmas. It is
not a question of whether a policy is inherently long-term, but which
factors primarily influence legislators’ decisions when allocating
resources in these areas. We hypothesize that in policy areas
characterized by long time horizons for policy effects to become
apparent, decision-making will be heavily influenced by long-term
considerations, even if politicians are incentivized to find short-term
alternatives. When comparing different policy areas within a single
country, it is reasonable to assume that all these areas would be
similarly susceptible to short-term bias, given that they are influenced
by the same set of legislators working under broadly similar systemic
conditions. This argument postulates that policy areas that offer
numerous opportunities for short-term policy implementation will be
driven primarily by such considerations, despite occasional instances of
long-term strategic planning. In essence, policymakers are expected to
opt for short-term policies whenever possible, and the differentiation
between short- and long-term domains is determined on the basis of these
opportunities.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> What to expect from policy?<a href="theory.html#what-to-expect-from-policy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Short-term influential policies (<span class="math inline">\(i_s\)</span>) can range across various
domains, such as economic stimulus packages, or infrastructure projects.
These policies are largely determined by the opportunities that these
domains present for immediate implementation. For instance, a stimulus
package can be quickly enacted to boost economic growth and building
infrastructure is largely visible in daily lives. The immediacy of the
outcomes associated with these issues enables voters to relate the
actions of their representatives directly to the subsequent
consequences. This fosters a sense of agency among voters, which
influences their voting decisions. As a result, politicians are likely
to be more encompassed by public opinion on these issues
(<span class="math inline">\(R_m(i_s) &gt; R_m(i_l)\)</span>). Additionally, I expect that responsiveness to
young adults in these areas will be significantly lower than
responsiveness to older citizens (<span class="math inline">\(R_y(i_s) &lt; R_y(i_l)\)</span>). This is
because younger voters are more likely to support policies with
long-term effects since they will reap the benefits of these policies in
the future. Additionally, the mitigating function of dynamic
representation is less likely to increase traditional political
participation among young voters in this time horizon. As a consequence,
the comparatively lower turnout of the younger population is expected to
play a significant role. In contrast, Long-Term Influential issues
(<span class="math inline">\(i_l\)</span>) are political matters that require a longer period of time to
manifest their effects. These issues require a proactive,
forward-looking approach, and the full extent of their impact usually
not be apparent within a politician’s current term of office. Examples
of such issues include tackling climate change or reforming pension
systems. Politicians may be inclined to sideline these issues in favor
of their short-term counterparts, even though the benefits of long-term
policies may be considerable. The potential benefits of long-term
policies are not only uncertain but also delayed, often becoming
apparent after the current government has left office or even benefiting
future governments. This factor introduces a degree of risk for
vote-seeking politicians, which may result in less attention being paid
to these issues (<span class="math inline">\(R_m(i_l) &lt; R_m(i_s)\)</span>). However, as these issues are of
minimal relevance for the upcoming elections, I expect policymakers to
be more responsive to young adults compared to short-term policy
(<span class="math inline">\(R_y(i_l) &gt; R_y(i_s)\)</span>). The time horizon dimension underlines the
inherent political trade-offs in policy formulation, which are
constrained by electoral incentives. Policymakers are forced to weigh
the immediate political benefits of short-term policies against the
potentially greater but less tangible benefits of long-term policies.
This framework allows us to systematically explore the responsiveness of
policymakers across different issue areas and age groups. By mapping
issue areas onto this matrix, I can conduct detailed analyses of how
responsiveness varies across these categories. This, in turn, can shed
light on the relative influence of dynamic and group representation
theories in different policy contexts.</p>

Figure 2.2: Comprehensive overview of expected responsiveness
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:framework-1">2.2</a> provides a comprehensive overview of the
expected responsiveness to the median voter and young voters, based on
the exceptions of group relevance and time horizon. The first arrow
represents the hypnotized effect according to the time horizon
dimension, the second arrow represents the expected effect of the group
representation. Tiles where I expect an overall positive effect are
blue, and tiles with an overall negative effect are grey. The
darker-colored tiles are compared. We argue that both dynamics are
important drivers of responsiveness, but their impact differs depending
on the time horizon of the policy. We expect policymakers to be mainly
driven by electoral incentives when evaluating short-term policies,
while group representation is the main driver for long-term policies.
The predictions are</p>
<div class="hypothesis">
<p><span id="hyp:H3" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.3  </strong></span><span class="math inline">\(R_m(i_s) &gt; R_m(\neg i_s)\)</span><br />
Responsiveness in short-term-issue areas is higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="hypothesis">
<p><span id="hyp:H4" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.4  </strong></span><span class="math inline">\(R_m(r_y) &lt; R_m(\neg r_y)\)</span><br />
Responsiveness in issue areas particularly relevant to younger citizens
is lower.</p>
</div>
<div class="hypothesis">
<p><span id="hyp:H5" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.5  </strong></span><span class="math inline">\(R_m(i_s \land r_y) &gt; R_m(\neg i_s \land \neg r_y)\)</span><br />
Responsiveness in short-term issue areas particularly relevant to
younger citizens is higher than in long-term issue areas relevant to
median citizens.</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, I expect group relevance and time horizon to influence
responsiveness to young adults. We expect responsiveness to young adults
to be less relevant in the short time horizon, as their low turnout does
not provide electoral incentives. In addition, the small number of young
representatives has a limited impact on policy-making, which will only
be significant in areas that are relevant to young adults. At the same
time, policymakers have incentives to involve young voters in issues
with long-term implications. These are likely to be particularly
favorable in areas where they are supported by group representatives,
but should also have a mitigating impact where issues are more relevant
to older people or the general public. Based on this, I hypothesize the
responsiveness to young voters as follows:</p>
<div class="hypothesis">
<p><span id="hyp:H6" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.6  </strong></span><span class="math inline">\(R_y(i_s) &lt; R_y(\neg i_s)\)</span><br />
Responsiveness to young voters is in short-term-issue areas lower.</p>
</div>
<div class="hypothesis">
<p><span id="hyp:H7" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.7  </strong></span><span class="math inline">\(R_y(r_y) &gt; R_y(\neg r_y)\)</span><br />
Responsiveness to young voters is in issue areas relevant to young
citizens higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="hypothesis">
<p><span id="hyp:H8" class="hypothesis"><strong>Hypothesis 2.8  </strong></span><span class="math inline">\(R_y(\neg i_s \land \neg r_y) &gt; R_y(i_s \land r_y)\)</span><br />
Responsiveness to young voters in long-term issue areas relevant to
median citizens is higher than the responsiveness to young voters in
short-term issue areas particularly relevant to younger citizens.</p>

<p>Scholarship on the substantive representation of ethnic minorities,
women, (income) class, and sexual orientation has expanded over the
years, with many studies focusing on a single country and issue

the study of class differences, as several studies examine the variation
in responsiveness to income groups across countries, issues, and years

this methodological experience, I incorporate cross-sectional time
series techniques. These techniques allow us to identify broader trends
that cut across different national circumstances and temporal dynamics.
Using two-way linear fixed effects regression (2FE) on data from 25
affluent democracies over the past twenty years, I aim to offer an
understanding of the mechanisms by which representation in legislative
assemblies and interest group mobilization of this population affect
this central relationship.</p>
