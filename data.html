<p>The present research seeks to determine the extent to which
policy-making in developed democracies is consistent with the
preferences of their younger citizens. I focus on changes rather than
static levels because I am interested in the link between attitudes to
future policy and subsequent policy implementation, both of which relate
to changes rather than levels. But the task faces empirical hurdles
related to matching robust, consistent measures of public attitudes
towards specific policy reforms with measures of subsequent changes in
social policy regulation - measures robust enough to support significant
causal inferences about representation. Previous studies of influence
have attempted to link attitudinal trends among particular groups to the
adoption of policies in subsequent years, either by hand-coding policy
changes or by using government expenditure data. Both options have
drawbacks. While the use of actual policy change is more accurate on the
surface, hand-coding those data is subject to several biases such as
confirmation bias <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nickerson1998">Nickerson 1998</a>)</span> or selection bias <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bevan2013">Bevan et al. 2013</a>)</span>. While
usually several strategies are implemented to mitigate these, it’s
important to note that no method can completely eliminate bias from
human-coded data <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dehaas2015">de Haas, Natter, and Vezzoli 2015</a>)</span>. Furthermore, these data are scarce due
to the high level of coding involved and the subsequent need to adapt
them to a specific research design. On the other hand, expenditure data
are prone to what is known in the literature as the “dependent variable
problem” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-alesina2001">Alesina and Barro 2001</a>; <a href="#ref-siegel2007">Siegel 2007</a>)</span>, which refers to the problem that
expenditure indicators never exclusively explain actual legislative
changes. <span class="citation">Esping-Andersen (<a href="#ref-esping-andersen1990">1990</a>)</span> noted that expenditure, especially when
measured as a share of GDP, can provide a potentially misleading picture
of policy differences. The main problem lies in the inherent difficulty
of distinguishing whether a chosen change is the result of responsive
policies or of factors beyond national control. As <span class="citation">Allan and Scruggs (<a href="#ref-allan2004">2004</a>)</span> point out,
the ratio of expenditure to GDP can be misleading, especially in times
of economic recession when the denominator of the measure falls.
Although a nominal focus on changes in spending is ambiguous, it is a
valuable source of information as it indicates if respondents are met.
As long as the government’s main policy instruments are involved with
increasing or decreasing spending in that area I can capture the
responsiveness to that preferences adequately. Thus, I must critically
put in question in which areas, changes in public spending actually
reflect the policy change. <span class="citation">Brooks and Manza (<a href="#ref-brooks2006">2006a</a>)</span> have argued that government
officials are particularly responsible for the redistribution of wealth
and should therefore be responsive to public preferences regarding the
welfare state, resulting in what they call Welfare State Effort. The
rich political economy literature has tested this link, particularly in
the context of welfare spending, and has provided robust evidence for
the correlation between preferences and welfare state spending in
advanced democracies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-esping-andersen1990">Esping-Andersen 1990</a>; <a href="#ref-burstein2003">Burstein 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-brooks2006a">Brooks and Manza 2006b</a>; <a href="#ref-soroka2009">Soroka and Wlezien 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-wlezien2009">Wlezien and Soroka 2009</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>We address these empirical challenges by matching changes in public
spending in specific issue areas with the preferences expressed by the
population for spending changes in those same areas. This task is
accomplished by matching data on government spending in specific key
areas provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) with data from the International Social Survey
Programme (ISSP). It is therefore reasonable to expect that differences
in social spending across countries and time periods are likely to be of
explanatory importance. The ISSP data covers preferences towards
spending in nine areas: total spending, the environment; health; the
police and law enforcement; education; the military and defense; old age
pensions; unemployment benefits; culture/arts. The government
expenditure database by the OECD <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oecd_spend2023">OECD 2023</a>)</span> provides a breakdown
of government expenditure according to the Classification of the
Functions of Government (COFOG) from the European system of accounts
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-eurostat2013">Eurostat 2013</a>)</span>. For the purposes of this study, I use data from the
OECD because of its inherent advantages. OECD’s standardized,
transparent data collection methods, coupled with the homogeneity of its
member countries in terms of democratic practices and administrative
capacity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wilensky2002">Wilensky 2002</a>)</span>, significantly reduce the likelihood of bias.
This does not mean, however, that all OECD countries are perfectly
homogeneous. Differences remain in political, social, and economic
contexts, including public policies, social structures, and political
institutions. For instance, a Nordic welfare state like Sweden is very
different from a more liberal market economy like the US, although both
are OECD countries. It’s also important to note that the use of OECD
data alone may be subject to selection bias if the research question
extends beyond the OECD context. In particular, the generalisability of
my findings beyond the OECD context is limited because OECD countries
are predominantly high-income countries and therefore do not adequately
represent the global community. Therefore, the interpretation of my
results within this specific context will be of critical importance.</p>
<p>Figures <a href="data.html#fig:oecd-spend-1">3.1</a> and <a href="data.html#fig:oecd-spend-2">3.2</a> show the
included types of services. These records cover several OECD countries
and extend from 1995 to 2022. However, my investigation is limited to a
specific period, 1996 to 2016, for the purpose of synchronization with
data from the ISSP, while the use of expenditure data is extended to
2020 to allow for the lagged effects of policy implementation. The
surveys conducted by the ISSP during this period provide valuable data
that complement my analysis. Consequently, the temporal limitation is
necessitated by the available surveys conducted in 1996, 2006, and 2016.
Our empirical analysis focuses on 25 countries for which I have data for
at least one point in time within the chosen timeframe. These countries
are Austria, Belgium, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. If respondents
express a preference for increased spending, and this is followed by an
actual increase in spending in the area in question in subsequent years,
this is interpreted as evidence of responsiveness for the group in
question. Similarly, if a preference for a reduction is followed by a
decrease in spending in subsequent years, this is also considered to be
evidence of responsiveness. As the political process often takes some
time, I have to take into account the lagged effects of policy changes.
To measure changes in spending over the four years following the survey,
I follow the widely used moving average approach <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-soroka2005">Soroka and Wlezien 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-kymlicka2006">Kymlicka and Banting 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-schakel2020">Schakel, Burgoon, and Hakhverdian 2020</a>)</span>. It is important to note that my research
uses <em>country-year-issue</em> as the primary unit of analysis. Therefore,
the total number of cases can be interpreted from this perspective. In
theory, my indicator ranges from 0 to 100 and symbolizes a percentage of
the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), calculated in local currency
with 2015 as the base year.</p>

</div>
<p>Looking at the data, Figure <a href="data.html#fig:oecd-spend-1">3.1</a> shows total annual
government expenditure. The years 1996, 2006, and 2016, represented by
the vertical lines, are the years in which the preferences were
measured. These preferences were then compared with the changes in
expenditure over the following four years. The average government
expenditure in the countries studied was around 45 percent of GDP,
although in some cases it exceeded 60 percent of GDP. Total government
expenditure was significantly higher in the mid-1990s and after the 2008
financial crisis. Thereafter, however, a steady decline was observed
until a sudden increase in 2016. In particular, the change in
expenditure in 2016 is indicative of the fluctuations in the following
four years up to 2020. The observed trend is important because it
provides valuable insight into the distribution of changing
expenditures. Moreover, the trend may already indicate that developed
democracies are facing a shrinking tax base, which puts more pressure on
the prioritization of spending and, under normal circumstances, on the
need to reduce overall spending. However, the rapid increases after 2008
and 2015 may be related to external factors. Looking more closely at the
different areas of expenditure, the highest shares of total expenditure
were allocated to pensions, education, and health. These are the main
drivers of social expenditure. Conversely, unemployment, the last
welfare factor measured in this study, accounted for around 1 percent on
average, with considerable variation between countries. Expenditure on
pensions also varied considerably, with some countries spending as much
as 15 percent of GDP on pensions. Expenditure on defense and public
security, on the other hand, was more consistent across countries at
around 2 percent. A notable outlier is Israel, which spends almost 8
percent of its GDP on defense. In contrast, expenditure on cultural
services and environmental protection remained low, averaging less than
1 percent.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:oecd-spend-2"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 3.2: Change in government expenditure by issue area
</p>
</div>
<p>The change in spending averaged over the subsequent four years is
presented in Figure <a href="data.html#fig:oecd-spend-2">3.2</a>. We can see that government
spending on different categories of expenditure has varied considerably.
Starting from 1996, health, education, old age, and unemployment have
all experienced changes in expenditure, with a particularly high
variance in expenditure for unemployment, which has a standard deviation
(SD) of 9.62. In the late 1990s, we see a trend of increased spending on
health and education. For instance, in 1997, health expenditure changed
by 1.75 percent, while education spending experienced a minor change of
0.0139 percent. At the same time, spending on pensions was slightly
reduced, and unemployment saw a substantial reduction, with a change of
-5.14 percent. Around the 2000s, spending across all areas notably
fluctuated. A dramatic increase in unemployment spending was observed in
2005 and 2006, reaching a change of 16 and 17.7 percent respectively,
with very high variances (647 and 628 respectively), reflecting a
significant disparity in how countries dealt with unemployment during
that period. After the financial crisis in 2008, while spending on
health, education, and old age saw relative stability, unemployment
spending again varied widely. For instance, in 2010, unemployment
spending had a change of -4.55 percent, demonstrating the extreme
spending changes countries made in response to unemployment issues
during this period. In recent years, specifically in 2016, health saw a
substantial increase in spending change (4.29 percent). This coincided
with a considerable rise in spending change in unemployment (19.7), with
a high SD of 21.8 and variance of 476, pointing to a broad disparity in
how different countries addressed unemployment issues. defense spending
experienced a major decline in the late 1990s with the largest fall
observed in 1996, with an average decrease of -3.21 percent. There was a
period of rebound in the early 2000s, with a slight dip in 2001, but
from 2002 onwards, there is a noticeable drop, bottoming in 2010 with an
average decrease of -3.62 percent. However, defense spending increased
dramatically in 2015 and 2016, reaching a significant peak of 7.04
percent change in 2016. Public order and safety spending, on the other
hand, showed a generally steadier trend over the years. There was a
small decrease in 1996 (-0.197 percent) but the expenditure level
steadily rose afterwards. The years 2005 and 2016 saw the most
substantial increases, with 1.92 percent and 1.70 percent respectively.
For environmental protection spending, there is a clear upward trend
starting from 1996. It reached its peak in 2001 with an impressive
increase of 6.40 percent. However, it started declining in 2012 and
reached a low of -2.00 percent in 2012. Afterward, there was a gradual
recovery and the spending increased by 3.19 percent in 2016. Cultural
services spending also saw a varied trajectory, with a noticeable
increase in 1998 (2.77 percent) and a sharp fall in 2009 and 2011.
However, spending recovered in the subsequent years and reached an
increase of 1.98 percent in 2016.</p>
<p>Looking at the spending levels between countries there is considerable
variation, which contributes positively to measures of responsiveness,
as it allows to observe patterns and changes in spending, which can then
be compared with changes in public opinion data. It is important to
emphasize that social welfare expenditure represents a large proportion
of total government expenditure. As such, changes in this area can have
a significant impact on the government’s budget and a major impact on
the well-being of the population. However, not all expenditure areas
show rapid change. Some areas, such as the environment, defense, and
pensions, tend to show slower changes in spending. This slower pace may
be due to the inherent nature of these sectors. For example,
environmental policies or defense strategies tend to require long-term
planning and cannot be changed abruptly without potential disruption.
Possible reasons for these differences in speed could be related to the
short or long-term effects of policy changes. In areas such as
unemployment, policy changes may have immediate and visible effects,
which could lead to faster spending responses. On the other hand, policy
changes in areas such as environment or defense may have more delayed
effects, leading to slower spending adjustments. In addition, changes in
pension policy tend to be slower due to the long-term nature of these
benefits and the need for stability and predictability for
beneficiaries. Abrupt changes can disrupt the livelihoods of a
significant proportion of the population, especially the elderly, so
governments could be inclined to take a more gradual approach in these
areas. In the next section, I take a closer look at the measures of
public preferences before discussing whether and how I can reasonably
match these variables.</p>

<p>Citizen attitudes are gathered from the multi-country International
Social Science Programme (ISSP), conducted in 25 OECD countries in 1996
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-issp1999">ISSP Research Group 1999</a>)</span>, 2006 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-issp2021">ISSP Research Group 2021</a>)</span> and 2016 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-issp2018">ISSP Research Group 2018</a>)</span>. The ISSP’s repeated
Role of Government module provides valuable insights into public
preferences for increasing or decreasing government spending in these
areas, and allows this research to reliably quantify support for such
government expenditure across a wide range of countries and years. The
available data provided by the ISSP cover preferences towards spending
in nine areas: total spending, the environment; health; the police and
law enforcement; education; the military and defense; old age pensions;
unemployment benefits; culture and arts. To ensure homogeneity, the
response categories have been systematically restructured: strong
agreement with the increase in spending is given a score of 100, simple
agreement is given 50, neutral is given 0, disagreement is given -50,
and strong disagreement is given -100. These data cover a relatively
long period of time, in most OECD countries, and a wide range of issues.
The questions in the Role of Government module have multiple advantages.
They have been carried out in a similar way three times in 20 years and
shed light on trends in preferences for the welfare state and a range of
democratic functions in developed democracies on which citizens might be
expected to have an opinion. The questions are designed to capture
respondents’ views on the expansion or contraction of spending, thereby
measuring shifts proportional to the existing size of the program under
consideration. Although these questions nominally focus on expenditure,
the implication of a change in expenditure indicates a change in program
dimensions. However, such results may also be the result of a particular
reallocation of resources or a modification of the organizational
structure. As a result, respondents are not expected to perform fiscal
accounting, but primarily to articulate how they feel about future
outcomes.</p>
<p>The challenge of studying youth political representation begins with an
inherently definitional problem: defining who qualifies as young is less
definitive than other socio-political categories, such as gender or
ethnicity. In the academic discourse on young adults, researchers often
operationalize young adults as individuals under the age of 30, 35, or
40 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stockemer2021">Stockemer and Sundström 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-joshi2013">Joshi 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-belschner2020">Belschner and Garcia de Paredes 2020</a>)</span>, following the advice of
the Interparlamentarion Union <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-IPU2016">Union 2016</a>)</span>. In particular, a demarcation
at the age of 40 has advantages when studying descriptive representation
due to prevailing institutional constraints: some legislative bodies
enforce high minimum age requirements for office, and it is rare to
observe individuals securing office before the age of 35
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-belschner2020">Belschner and Garcia de Paredes 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-IPU2016">Union 2016</a>)</span>. However, as the present study is concerned
mainly with substantive representation, it is less constrained by such
institutional limitations. Given an approximate average life expectancy
of roughly 80 years during the period under study <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-harman2006">Harman 2006</a>)</span>, the
40-year threshold includes half of that life expectancy, making it
implausible. The choice of an age cut-off necessarily involves a degree
of arbitrariness; thus, this study uses the commonly used cut-off of 35
years. I postulate that any significant effect observed at this level
should be equal or stronger if the cut-off is lowered to 30 years, thus
providing a more convincing argument than a significant finding that
might not persist with a higher cut-off.</p>
<p>As argued, the issue of uncrystallized substantive interests is
inextricably linked to the demand for substantive representation, which
leads us to question the age at which this demand emerges. The age of
eligibility to vote is generally 18, while some countries are discussing
or have already implemented a voting age of 16 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rosenqvist2017">Rosenqvist 2017</a>)</span>. This
might be a plausible threshold, as it symbolizes the transition to
formal political participation. However, this methodologically
convenient cut-off point leads to several complications: my research
also seeks to capture non-conventional forms of political expression
that are not subject to formal age restrictions; political interests do
not emerge spontaneously upon reaching voting age, but are usually
present earlier, as evidenced by discussions on lowering the voting age
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zeglovits2014">Zeglovits and Aichholzer 2014</a>)</span>; and the implementation of different age cut-off points
across my sample may introduce bias due to unequal representation. With
these considerations in mind, my study examines the substantive
representation of people aged between 15 and 34. This strategy allows us
to capture the political effects of those who are currently eligible to
vote, or who will be eligible to vote within the next three years,
without introducing bias by excluding a significant non-voting cohort.
Therefore, in the context of this study, I use the terms “young adults”,
“young people”, “the youth”, “young voters” interchangeably to refer to
individuals in this age.</p>

<p>Since the 1970s numerous empirical studies have shown evidence for a
generational shift from material needs to post-materialist values, as
societies become more affluent and secure. In many contexts, younger and
older generations have distinct preferences regarding how politicians
should distribute limited government resources: Younger generations tend
to favor spending on quality of life and equality <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-abramson1995">Abramson and Inglehart 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-kitschelt1988">Kitschelt 1988</a>; <a href="#ref-lichtin2023">Lichtin, van der Brug, and Rekker 2023</a>)</span> and especially support environmental
protection <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gough2008">Gough et al. 2008</a>)</span>. Older generations in contrast show greater
support for military spending <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wattenberg2020">Wattenberg 2020</a>)</span>. However in some areas
like welfare state, generational differences are under question,
especially if they are driven by self-interest <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ebbinghaus2017">Ebbinghaus and Naumann 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-greer2021">Greer et al. 2021</a>)</span>. Older citizens, typically prefer greater spending on public
pensions and healthcare<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sihvo1995">Sihvo and Uusitalo 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-goerres2009">Goerres 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-naumann2017">Naumann 2017</a>)</span>, while
young adults are more inclined with education <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-busemeyer2009">Busemeyer, Goerres, and Weschle 2009</a>)</span>, which
both disproportionately benefit the respective age group.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="data.html#fig:issp-pref">3.3</a> provides a comprehensive analysis of public
opinion on government spending, the data in this study describe the
preferences of citizens under the age of 35 compared to their older
counterparts for spending changes, averaged across all countries
surveyed, by issue and by year. One striking pattern that emerges from
the data is an increased value placed on education by younger
demographic groups, a finding that confirms previous research. This
preference has been consistent over time, with the percentage of younger
demographic groups supporting an increase in education spending measured
at 48 percent in 1996, 52.8 percent in 2006, and 52.6 percent in 2016.
Cultural services and environmental protection show similar trends, as
might be expected given their strong correlation with non-material
issues. The younger population has shown constant support for
environmental protection, with support levels of 38.8 against 28.9 in
1996, 35.8 against 29.5 in 2006, and 31.8 against 25.6 in 2016. While
this support has declined over time, it remains stronger than that of
older generations. Younger citizens also show a tendency to support
increases in unemployment benefits, although this effect is subject to
considerable fluctuations over time. Meanwhile, older people have shown
more robust support for spending on pensions, consistently outstripping
younger people. A similar trend can be seen for public safety, possibly
reflecting generational differences in societal perceptions or
increasing safety demands with age. However, health spending shows
minimal variation, suggesting that the equity demands of younger
generations may coincide with the self-interest of older citizens who
rely heavily on health services. Although both age groups generally
express opposition to increased defense spending, as indicated by
negative scores, this opposition appears to diminish over time.
Specifically, the older population’s score gradually increases from
-17.8 in 1996 to 5.52 in 2016, suggesting a shift from opposition to
support. This finding, although interesting, is beyond the scope of my
study.</p>
<p>In addition, it is worth noting that public sentiment towards government
spending as a whole has declined significantly over the two decades
covered by these data. Notwithstanding the persistently negative
sentiment towards government spending as a whole, there is a trend that
suggests a shift towards a more favorable view. This apparent
contradiction could be explained by several factors. First, the
divergence may be due to the fiscal illusion that taxpayers often
underestimate the true cost of goods and services provided by the
government, leading to a preference for increased government spending in
certain areas. However, when asked about overall government spending,
respondents may be considering the wider implications of such spending,
such as higher taxes or larger budget deficits, hence their overall
negative sentiment <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dollery1996">Dollery and Worthington 1996</a>)</span>. Second, it’s important to recognize
that public preferences are not monolithic, but rather the aggregation
of individual preferences. When respondents express a preference for
increased spending in a particular area, they may be indicating a desire
for a shift in budgetary priorities rather than an overall increase in
spending. Thus, when asked about overall spending, they may still be
expressing a negative sentiment if they believe that current levels are
excessive or poorly allocated <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bremer2022">Bremer and Bürgisser 2022</a>)</span>. Third, the phenomenon may
be due to a perceived disconnect between government spending and the
outcomes it produces. Individuals may have reservations about the
overall efficiency or effectiveness of government spending [as already
discussed in the context of long-term commitments <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jacobs2011">Alan M. Jacobs 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-jacobs2016">Alan M. Jacobs 2016</a>, to name just one possible explanation)</span>. These concerns
could lead to negative attitudes towards overall spending, even if they
support increased funding in areas that directly affect their lives. The
contradiction between preferences for increased spending in specific
areas and opposition to overall government spending thus underlines the
need to ask what my measurement is about. This research uses data that
ask about preferences for more or less spending on particular issues,
which has some drawbacks. I am aware that opinions expressed are not so
much about the spending itself as about the implied consequences.
Therefore, for each issue area, it has been critically asked whether it
is plausible to reconcile the measured preferences with government
expenditure data. The data analyzed provides tangible evidence of clear
differences in most of the areas covered. I suggest that younger adults
are more supportive of education, cultural services, and environmental
protection. Conversely, older citizens are more supportive of pensions,
public safety, and defense. Unemployment benefits and health are not
clearly allocated. The following section will take a closer look at each
issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="issue-areas" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="3.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Issue areas<a href="data.html#issue-areas" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Our research uses data that ask about preferences for more or less
spending on particular issues, which has some drawbacks. Therefore, for
each issue area, I discuss three major issues at stake: (1) What are
respondents intended preferences when they express their opinion towards
more or less spending? (2) Can we expect to see responsiveness reflected
in changed spending? (3) What political trade-offs do policymakers face
when making spending decisions?</p>
<div id="overall-government-spending" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Overall government spending<a href="data.html#overall-government-spending" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In order to understand preferences regarding government spending, it is
crucial to consider what respondents have in mind when they express
their views. In terms of overall public spending, it is possible that a
tendency to increase spending is linked to a desire for a wider range of
public services, better infrastructure, or a possible expectation of
economic stimulus. Conversely, a tendency towards lower spending could
represent a desire for fiscal austerity, a more compact government
structure, or a reduction in taxation. Given the wide range of policy
areas that total government spending can cover, it remains a challenge
to decipher a definitive pattern of responsiveness in spending changes
that reflects these preferences. I have therefore chosen to exclude them
from my subsequent examination.</p>
</div>
<div id="education" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Education<a href="data.html#education" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Preferences for spending on education show strong support for an
increase across society, but it is particularly pronounced among younger
demographic groups, as evidenced by the research conducted by
<span class="citation">Busemeyer, Goerres, and Weschle (<a href="#ref-busemeyer2009">2009</a>)</span> and reinforced by my findings derived from the
International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data. In the context of
advanced democracies, it is reasonable to assume that most respondents
understand the concept of education, albeit with ambiguity about the
implications of increased spending on it. Consequently, I suggest that
this inclination towards increased spending largely reflects a desire
for improved quality of education in relation to respondents’ perceived
evaluation of the existing education system.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Policymakers
have a wide range of policy tools at their disposal when formulating
decisions on education spending. Although there are a variety of
strategies for implementing policies that affect daily life, such as
changes in school or university regulations, I argue that the desired
quality of education is primarily financed through teacher competence.
Most spending is therefore catalyzed by the imperative need for a highly
skilled workforce. As such, improvements in educational standards will
have a strong correlation with expenditure. Increasing the size or skill
level of the workforce requires significant structural changes, which
typically have a long-term time horizon with results that may take
several years or even decades to manifest. As a result, I expect changes
in spending to accurately reflect policymakers’ long-term fiscal
decisions, with education being of primary importance for the younger
population. For example, research by <span class="citation">Bertocchi et al. (<a href="#ref-bertocchi2020">2020</a>)</span> suggests that a one
percent increase in youth voter turnout leads to a 0.77 percent increase
in higher education spending. This finding reinforces my expectation in
two ways: first, it highlights the unique importance of this sector for
young adults, and second, it underscores the importance of conventional
political participation, which is typically associated with issue areas
driven by long-term spending decisions.</p>
</div>
<div id="pensions" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> Pensions<a href="data.html#pensions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Preferences for increased spending on pensions tend to be more
pronounced among older population groups, a trend confirmed by several
academic studies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sihvo1995">Sihvo and Uusitalo 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-goerres2009">Goerres 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-naumann2017">Naumann 2017</a>)</span>. By analogy
with the education scenario, it can be concluded that the propensity to
escalate spending is largely driven by the pursuit of enhanced pension
benefits. In navigating the complex landscape of pension spending
decisions, a key challenge is to strike a balance between meeting the
immediate needs of current pensioners and ensuring the long-term
sustainability of the system for future generations. The policy
mechanisms that affect pension levels range from changes in the
retirement age to revisions in the benefit formula and adjustments in
contribution rates. However, these different approaches share a common
theme: they determine both the number of beneficiaries and the level of
their benefits, which in turn leads to variations in total expenditure.
Increasing pension benefits requires a larger pool of resources, which
increases expenditure. Consequently, a preference for higher spending is
inherently linked to a preference for higher pension benefits. Given the
significant direct impact of pensions on the lives of older adults, this
area takes on immense importance. For example, <span class="citation">Goerres (<a href="#ref-goerres2009">2009</a>)</span> shows that
pension-related issues are often strong motivators for political
engagement among older adults. Although (national) pension systems
typically do not involve direct payments from the government but rather
represent large transfer accounts <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-OECD2017">OECD 2017</a>)</span>, any changes to pensions
inherently take a long-term perspective. This is due to the fact that
the full impact of reform measures often only becomes apparent over a
longer period of time.</p>
</div>
<div id="health" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4</span> Health<a href="data.html#health" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In my study of demographic preferences for government spending, I found
an overarching preference for increased spending across all age groups,
with no clear preference for either the young or the old. This
observation differs from what might be expected given the tendency of
older populations to require more regular and intensive medical
services, suggesting a potential for greater policy responsiveness to
this demographic group in health-related matters <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sihvo1995">Sihvo and Uusitalo 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-goerres2009">Goerres 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-naumann2017">Naumann 2017</a>)</span>. However, this assumption could be balanced
by the tendency of younger generations to advocate spending that
improves the quality of life and promotes equality <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-abramson1995">Abramson and Inglehart 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-kitschelt1988">Kitschelt 1988</a>; <a href="#ref-lichtin2023">Lichtin, van der Brug, and Rekker 2023</a>)</span>, principles that are intrinsically linked
to the concept of national health insurance. This dichotomy presents two
potentially conflicting perspectives on the issue: the first emphasizes
improving the overall quality of health care, while the second advocates
greater equality. The drive for greater equity would require the
expansion of national insurance, which like improving quality, would be
reflected in changes in spending patterns. This nuanced landscape of
preferences and spending trends, which vary across countries and over
time, provides an invaluable lens through which to examine the primary
motivations behind policy decisions. While legislators generally have no
incentive to promote the interests of their specific demographic groups,
examining whether spending allocations are more closely aligned with the
preferences of the young or the old can provide insights into these
primary drivers. In the health sector, government spending is mainly
targeted at health infrastructure, services, public health initiatives,
and research, and includes activities such as hospital funding, drug
subsidies, prevention programs, and investment in medical research. Some
of these efforts, such as infrastructure development, are long-term
investments, but I argue that there are many ways in which government
budgets can be used for immediate improvements. For example, a
significant proportion of health care is dependent on the level of
national insurance; changes to this will have an immediate impact on
both public perception and government spending.</p>
</div>
<div id="unemployment" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5</span> Unemployment<a href="data.html#unemployment" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Our examination of public attitudes to unemployment spending across age
cohorts reveals a common preference to increase spending, albeit to a
much lesser extent than other welfare state concerns examined. The data
suggest that the younger population is slightly more supportive of
increasing such spending, a trend that was marginally evident in 2006
but significant in other years. In contrast, older demographic groups
appear to be more resistant to policy interventions aimed at reducing
income inequality at least in the United States <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wattenberg2020">Wattenberg 2020</a>)</span>. The
dataset, which comes from advanced democracies, allows to conclude that
respondents generally have a good understanding of the concept of
unemployment. As a result, I postulate that an inclination towards
increased spending essentially symbolizes a desire for more
comprehensive unemployment insurance coverage and dynamic labor market
policies aimed at reducing unemployment rates, a factor that should be
reflected in changes in spending. Policy decisions on unemployment
spending cover a range of different instruments, like unemployment
insurance schemes, active labor market policies such as retraining
programs, and structural changes to support labor demand. Each of these
instruments has different implementation times and degrees of
effectiveness. For example, changes to unemployment insurance benefits
can be implemented quickly and have an immediate impact on
beneficiaries, thus being classified as short-term initiatives. This
observation is consistent with a significant fluctuation in changes in
unemployment benefits in my OECD data, coupled with considerable
heterogeneity in the way different countries deal with unemployment. On
the other hand, active labor market policies and structural changes,
including public investment in emerging industries, require longer
timeframes and produce tangible results only in the medium to long term.
But as in the case of health services, there is a wealth of
opportunities to implement policies with immediate visibility, such as
increasing financial subsidies.</p>
</div>
<div id="defense" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.6</span> Defense<a href="data.html#defense" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In conceptualizing voters’ preferences for an increase in defense
spending, I hypothesize that the focus is not on the direct impact on
unemployment benefits, but is primarily driven by ethical
considerations. Given that no OECD country was involved in territorial
conflicts during the period under study, I suggest that the vast
majority of preferences expressed by respondents are based on normative
judgments <span class="citation">(see for example, <a href="#ref-rudolph2022">Rudolph, Freitag, and Thurner 2022</a>)</span>. This hypothesis explains two
observations from my data. First, the aftermath of the Cold War and the
emergence of extensive peace movements in the 1980s understandably
correlate with a prominent majority in favor of reduced military
spending in the 1990s, an effect that dissipates over time. Second, the
generational shift towards a more egalitarian stance that embraces
transnational cooperation as opposed to nationalist protectionism,
correlates with even stronger opposition to defense spending, although
this trend is not uniformly evident in the 2016 survey. This theory is
supported by data showing increased support for military spending among
older generations <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wattenberg2020">Wattenberg 2020</a>)</span>, suggesting greater relevance within
this demographic. However, it could be argued that the complexity of
defense issues and the influence of various non-age-specific factors,
such as geopolitical considerations and defense industry lobbying, may
limit the extent to which policymakers can advocate for their social
groups. Nevertheless, I argue that a predominant proportion of MPs will
defend normative values similar to those of their contemporaries,
thereby demonstrating significant responsiveness. This is partly
supported by the descriptive data. The late 1990s saw a significant
decline in defense spending, with the steepest fall in 1996 when the
average decrease was -3.21 percent. There was a recovery in the early
2000s, albeit with a slight dip in 2001. However, since 2002 there has
been a noticeable decline, reaching its lowest point in 2010 with an
average fall of -3.62 percent. Conversely, there was a dramatic increase
in defense spending in 2015 and 2016, culminating in a significant peak
with a change of 7.04 percent in 2016. This illustrates the societal
shift from a position of opposition to increased spending to one of mild
support. Setting defense budgets is a complex exercise involving
political trade-offs. Policymakers must balance the need to maintain an
extensive defense establishment with other fiscal priorities. Defense
strategies often require investments in infrastructure, equipment
procurement, personnel training, and multi-year procurement contracts,
making these decisions somewhat impervious to short-term shifts in
public sentiment. Moreover, the expected outcomes of defense spending,
such as enhanced national security, are not immediately apparent to the
public, making it difficult for voters to relate these decisions to
their immediate outcomes. However, the majority of decisions are likely
to revolve around the procurement of equipment or the payment of
salaries, which I suggest will maintain a robust correlation with
spending data.</p>
</div>
<div id="public-safety" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.7</span> Public safety<a href="data.html#public-safety" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Public opinion on the allocation of resources to public safety
initiatives can be interpreted as a reflection of societal sentiment on
the need for enhanced security measures, increased law enforcement
resources, and comprehensive crime prevention strategies. Perceptions of
safety and security are inherently subjective and can be influenced by
various factors such as age, geographical location, and personal
experience. Younger demographic groups tend to be more concerned about
issues such as digital security, while their older counterparts may be
more concerned about physical security and property crime. The emphasis
on increasing police presence can be perceived as a conservative
viewpoint and tends to be associated predominantly with older
demographics, a pattern that is consistently supported by previous
research, including that conducted by <span class="citation">Wattenberg (<a href="#ref-wattenberg2020">2020</a>)</span>. In the context of
fiscal changes related to public safety, it can be hypothesized that
increases in public safety spending should generally be accompanied by
advances in public safety provision. These advances could take the form
of increased manpower or upgraded equipment, or they could result from
changes in the regulatory framework, which may not necessarily be
reflected in budgetary adjustments. However, it is important to bear in
mind that shifts in expenditure do not automatically signal policy
responsiveness, especially considering the possibility of false
negatives, where substantive policy changes may not be accurately
captured in the fiscal data. This notion could explain the observed
stability of public order and security spending over time, as shown by
my dataset. A marginal decrease of 0.197 percent was recorded in 1996,
but this was followed by a steady increase in expenditure. In
particular, the years 2005 and 2016 were marked by significant budget
expansions of 1.92 percent and 1.70 percent respectively. Issues related
to public safety have an immediate and tangible impact on the lives of
citizens, making them a crucial focus in the short-term policy arena.
Most actions taken to improve public safety are quickly visible, and any
shortcomings are equally quickly identified, giving this policy area a
heightened political sensitivity.</p>

<div id="environmental-protection" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.8">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.8</span> Environmental Protection<a href="data.html#environmental-protection" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Looking at the issue of environmental protection, there is a broad
societal consensus in favor of increased spending, although younger
people are more inclined to do so. However, this diverse contextual
scope introduces potential discrepancies in the interpretation of
environmentalism. The prevailing literature suggests a discernible trend
of shifting concern from local environmental issues to broader climate
change policy <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dietz2007">Dietz, Dan, and Shwom 2007</a>)</span>. Our data, which is consistent with this
view, suggests that this shift may lead to a decline in support
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kenny2017">Kenny 2017</a>)</span>. Research in this area reveals substantive links between
environmentalism and intangible, left-wing, and libertarian values,
touching on both local environmental and climate change issues
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-inglehart1977">Inglehart 1977</a>; <a href="#ref-kriesi2010">Kriesi 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-gullberg2018">Gullberg and Aardal 2018</a>)</span>. These ideological leanings
are strikingly consistent with younger cohorts <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-abramson1995">Abramson and Inglehart 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-gough2008">Gough et al. 2008</a>)</span>. When addressing environmental protection through fiscal
policy, legislators have a diverse arsenal of strategies at their
disposal. Options range from direct commitments, such as funding
renewable energy initiatives, to indirect incentives, such as tax breaks
for environmentally friendly practices. As in the case of defense,
achieving significant improvements in environmental protection depends
primarily on substantial investment, often at the expense of short-term
welfare state policies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schulze2021">Schulze 2021</a>)</span>. This fiscal allocation is
necessitated by the integral technological innovation and infrastructure
development required. The effects of environmental policies typically
unfold over long periods of time. The full impact of current decisions
may not be felt for many years or even decades. Consequently, I suggest
that the high importance attached to environmental protection by younger
populations will not elicit a strong level of responsiveness, as it
contradicts the views of a large proportion of older MPs. Furthermore, I
expect changes in environmental spending to reflect the long-term
strategic considerations of policymakers. These should show comparable
responsiveness across the age spectrum, as the extended time horizon
serves to dilute the disadvantage of low participation rates among the
younger population while creating opportunities to show responsiveness
to this group.</p>

<div id="culture" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.9">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.9</span> Culture<a href="data.html#culture" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Analysis of the ISSP data reveals a discernible trend: younger cohorts
show an increased interest to increase cultural expenditure, a sentiment
not shared by their older counterparts. Understanding the implicit
meanings behind expressed preferences for increased or decreased
cultural spending is a complex task. Such expenditure can be allocated
in a variety of ways, from subsidizing local arts events to investing in
the preservation and maintenance of national heritage sites. As such,
the tendency to increase cultural spending may reflect a deeper yearning
for a richer, more accessible cultural milieu in one’s immediate
environment. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of preferences can vary
considerably across different age groups, potentially leading to a wide
range of interpretations of the issue. The diversity inherent in the
ways in which cultural funding is allocated poses a challenge to the
claim that an increase in government spending would to some extent
reflect the preferences expressed by different age groups. Consequently,
these factors are not included in the parameters of my analysis due to
their unreliable correlation with expressed preferences.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Control variables<a href="data.html#control-variables" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The focus of my research is on the variable of interest, namely the
change in government expenditure over a four-year period following a
survey. All country or issue-specific time-invariant predictors
influencing government expenditure remain constant and are therefore not
subject to discernible changes over time. However, it is crucial to
recognize the factors that simultaneously influence public preferences
and the evolution of government spending. In an effort to account for
this relationship, I have included three control variables in my model.
The first variable takes into account the policies implemented. The
origin of these policies is strongly linked to the ideological
convictions of the parties in power <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brooks2006">Brooks and Manza 2006a</a>; <a href="#ref-hobolt2008">Binzer Hobolt and Klemmensen 2007</a>)</span>. At the
same time, political parties in power can be seen as the expression of
public preferences through the democratic process of voting. This
paradigm is succinctly captured in <span class="citation">Mansbridge (<a href="#ref-mansbridge2003">2003</a>)</span> concept of promissory
representation. To ensure an accurate cross-country comparison over
time, I account for this potential confounding factor by incorporating
the ideological position of the ruling government into my model. Instead
of using the commonly used left-right political spectrum, I take a novel
approach by measuring the frequency of positive references to
non-economic demographic sectors in party manifestos. This data comes
from the Party Manifesto Project <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lehmann2023">Lehmann et al. 2023</a>)</span>, with a particular focus
on women, students, and age groups. This method offers a unique
advantage: it quantifies the ideological predispositions of governing
parties towards specific demographic groups, which is more in line with
my variables of interest than the traditional left-right spectrum. The
ideological positions of parties are calculated individually and then
averaged on the basis of the number of parties in government. While an
alternative approach would be to average positions according to the
distribution of parliamentary seats, such a method neglects the
consensus-driven nature of coalition governments <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sabatier2007">Sabatier and Weible 2007</a>)</span>. I have
therefore opted for the former method. Additionally, to capture changes
in government I use the average position in the four years after the
survey. The distribution is presented in figure <a href="data.html#fig:control">3.5</a>. The
maximum ranges up to 10 mentions on average in 1996 and declines
afterward. in 2016 each party in government have between 0 and 2.5
mentions in their manifesto.</p>

<p>The change in government expenditure is measured by the change in
government expenditure as a share of GDP. This method of calculation
provides an efficient, relative, and normalized understanding of
government spending and serves as an indicator of government priorities
over time. Particularly In this context of demographic changes,
fluctuations in government expenditure as a share of GDP provide a
critical measure of the relative importance that the government attaches
to different sectors. A second key advantage of this measurement
strategy is its ability to normalize government expenditure over
different time periods, irrespective of economic conditions or size.
This helps to maintain the comparability of government spending over
time, thus overcoming the methodological challenge of variable economic
performance. Furthermore, this method has the potential to disentangle
whether variations in the relative measure of government expenditure are
the result of deliberate policy choices or merely an arithmetic
by-product of economic fluctuations. As a result, this approach
increases the sensitivity of the measure to policy variations, but to
avoid measuring the GDP growth itself I additionally included GDP growth
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kang2010">Kang and Powell 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-wlezien2012">Wlezien and Soroka 2012</a>)</span> in the model. In this framework, a relative
change in expenditure could be due to an actual change in expenditure,
but it could also reflect fluctuations in GDP. For example, if
expenditure policy remains stable but GDP increases, the share of
expenditure will automatically appear smaller due to the increase in the
denominator. As a result, GDP growth is expected to have a negative
impact if the policy landscape remains unchanged. Given that GDP growth
has a uniform impact across all expenditure sectors, any observed
differences in impact, ranging from slightly negative to other
magnitudes, are likely to be due to changes in actual spending. This
underlines the importance of including GDP growth in the model to
disentangle the effects of economic changes from deliberate policy
choices. I again use the four years average. To account for the
asymmetric size of the age groups, I additionally include the ratio of
young adults to the total population, derived from the OECD data sets,
as a control variable in all models with separate age group effects. I
go on to discuss the structural approach to my data.</p>
<div id="cross-validating-data-matching" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Cross validating data matching<a href="data.html#cross-validating-data-matching" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>When matching different data sources, it is essential to validate and
confirm the data used <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-shimodaira2016">Shimodaira 2016</a>)</span>. This highlights the need to
cross-check the number of respondents per age group from the
International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data with the size of the
corresponding age group in a given country from the OECD data. There are
two reasons for this validation process. First, the ISSP dataset is a
collection of cross-national collaborations on topics important to
social science research, such as the role of government, social
networks, and social inequality. However, as the number of respondents
per age group in the ISSP data may not fully capture the diversity or
size of each age group in each country, cross-checking with OECD data
helps to ensure that the representation is proportionate and reflects
the demographics of each country. Secondly, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provides reliable,
high-quality, and comparable data on a wide range of topics, including
population demographics. Consequently, comparing ISSP data with OECD
data provides a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the
size and distribution of different age groups in a country. Furthermore,
this comparison is crucial for two reasons. It allows us to determine
whether the sample of respondents in the ISSP data is representative of
the country’s demographics as captured by the OECD data. It also ensures
that any public preference expressed in the ISSP data can be accurately
generalized to the corresponding age group in the population. Such
verification can therefore help to remove bias from the data and improve
the robustness of subsequent analysis and findings.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 3.6: Percentage of population in OECD data and on ISSP respondents
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="data.html#fig:match-data">3.6</a> shows the proportions of different age
groups per year from both datasets. Let’s look first at the old age
group. In 1996, the proportion of the ‘old’ age group in the sample is
about 68.5 percent(995 out of 1453), while in the population it is 50.8
percent. Similarly, in 2006 it is about 75.2 percent in the sample (1050
out of 1396) compared to 55.2 percent in the population. In 2016, the
figures are about 78.5 percent in the sample (1017 out of 1295) and 58.0
percent in the population. Looking at these figures, it’s clear that the
<em>old</em> age group is over-represented in the sample in all three years
compared to their actual proportions in the population. Let’s look at
the <em>young</em> age group the other way around. In 1996, the share of the
‘young’ age group in the sample is about 31.5 percent(458 out of 1453),
while in the population it is 29.4 percent. In 2006, it was about 24.8
percent in the sample (347 out of 1396) compared to 27.6 percent in the
population. In 2016, the figures are around 21.5 percent in the sample
(278 out of 1295) and 25.1 percent in the population. This analysis
shows that the young age group is fairly well represented in 1996, but
tends to be slightly under-represented in the sample for the years 2006
and 2016, compared to their actual proportions in the population. In
summary, while the ‘young’ age group is fairly well represented in 1996,
there appears to be a general over-representation of the old age group
and an under-representation of the young age group across all years when
compared with the country’s demographic data from the OECD. This
indicates a bias in the representation of age groups, which should be
taken into account when interpreting results derived from these data.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 3.7: Probability of a mismatch between population and respondents
</p>
</div>
<p>To account for the asymmetric size of the age groups, I include the
ratio of young adults to the total population as a control variable.
However, this integration of population proportions does not in itself
correct the skewness in the representation of age cohorts in the
respondent data collected in the ISSP surveys. This is due to the fact
that while the inclusion of population proportions helps to gain a
broader understanding of the structure of society and its potential
influence on the results obtained, it does not correct for the potential
bias caused by the uneven representation of different age groups within
the survey data. A commonly used statistical tool, the chi-square test,
is used to determine the presence of a significant association between
categorical variables <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-steiger1990">Steiger 1990</a>)</span>. In the current scenario, it is
used to determine whether there is a significant discrepancy between the
observed age group distribution in the ISSP data and the expected
distribution based on OECD data. If the calculated p-value is less than
the chosen significance threshold, the null hypothesis of equivalence
between the observed and expected distributions is rejected, and it is
concluded that there is a significant difference in the age group
distribution within the sampled data compared to the actual population.
This analysis is visually presented in Figure <a href="data.html#fig:nonrepres">3.7</a>. All
the data from Latvia and Lithuania that were found to be
unrepresentative raise serious questions about the data selection
methods used in these countries, leading to their exclusion. Other
questionable observations come mainly from the 1996 sample, possibly due
to the different methodological standards of the time. However, the
categorical exclusion of all observations exceeding a p-value of 0.05
may not be the optimal strategy for dealing with imbalances in age group
representation within your data. Relying solely on the result of a
chi-square test to exclude observations could lead to data distortion
and potential bias, potentially removing valuable information that is
integral to other facets of the analysis. To mitigate this, I undertake
a comprehensive examination of the distribution of the 63 observations
where the p-value exceeds the 1 percent significance threshold. As other
methods, such as weighting or oversampling, or undersampling, have
problems with increased variance of estimates and overfitting, I exclude
39 observations that exceed the 10 percent significance level. These are
mainly from the 1996 survey data. In addition, I ran my analysis at
several other levels to check robustness.</p>

<p>Exceptionally divergent data points, often referred to as outliers, can
severely compromise the legitimacy of any quantitative analysis, thereby
reducing the robustness of the resulting findings. When these biased
data points enter the computational analysis, they can potentially lead
to false conclusions and erroneous inferences due to the artificial
relationships they induce between the variables under consideration. The
reasons for such discrepancies range from errors in data collection to
inherent inconsistencies within the sampled population. However, it is
essential to bear in mind that outliers are not always problematic.
These different data points can sometimes provide critical insights into
the phenomenon being studied. Therefore, it is critical to understand
the context thoroughly and to provide a compelling rationale for
excluding outliers. More specifically, outliers could have an undue
influence on expenditure and preference data. For example, an abnormally
high value for expenditure could lead to an overestimation of the impact
of public preferences. Similarly, outliers in the preference data could
lead us to believe that there is a stronger or weaker correlation
between public preferences and spending, when this is not the case. A
well-known tool for quantifying the influence of observation within a
regression analysis is Cook’s distance. This metric represents the
cumulative change in the regression parameters when a particular
observation is omitted, thus indicating the overall influence of that
data point on the model. Observations that exceed three times the mean
of Cook’s distance values are commonly referred to as potential outliers
or influential data points <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barnett1994">Barnett and Lewis 1994</a>)</span>. Public preferences generally
do not show exceptionally high values. Figure <a href="data.html#fig:cook-cntry">3.8</a>
shows Cook’s distances for the government spending variable.</p>

<p>There are seven anomalous observations in my data, characterized by
values that are more than three times the mean. These anomalous figures
are all in the area of unemployment for a selected group of countries:
Australia, Switzerland, Spain, France, Israel, Japan, and Norway, and
all in 2016. The co-occurrence of these seven atypical data points
within the same year and domain may indicate peculiar fluctuations in
the unemployment rate for 2016, which deviate from the overall pattern
of the rest of the data. I assume that these unexpected fluctuations do
not represent phenomena that would significantly affect the correlation
between public spending and public preferences. I have therefore decided
to exclude these observations from my analysis in order to maintain the
integrity and consistency of the data. Figure <a href="data.html#fig:include">3.9</a> shows
the distribution of the remaining 370 observations in my data. When
working with unbalanced data like this, it’s important to consider
whether the unbalance could introduce bias or other problems into the
model. The imbalance could potentially be problematic if it is not
missing completely at random. As most of the missing data is based on
data collection in specific countries, I do not see any systematic
pattern that could be related to my relationship of interest.
Nevertheless, as a robustness check, I will perform additional analyses
using only complete cases.</p>
