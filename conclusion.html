<p>Substantive representation is an integral part of the health and
functioning of a democratic system. Numerous academic studies have
linked a lack of representation to the emergence of democratic deficits,
confirming its importance in society. The relevance of this issue
becomes particularly clear when one considers the younger demographic
group. Although often overlooked, this segment of the population plays a
key role in shaping the socio-political milieu, and its impact is
amplified by upcoming demographic shifts. The demographic transitions
predict a sharp rise in the dependency ratio, with an emphasis on young
people. This reality positions them as the backbone of economic
well-being and the center of social transfers. This is coupled with a
significant evolution in the belief system of the younger generation,
with a pronounced shift toward immaterial values and relational
equality. This emerging trend reinforces this group’s demand for
substantive representation, a demand that is likely to continue to grow.
Understanding the responsiveness of policymakers to the needs of
different social groups and identifying the dynamics that can strengthen
representation becomes a critical concern in this context. Unlike other
societal issues such as income inequality or minorities, age, along with
gender, provides a more comprehensive lens for comparison across
countries and time. Age transcends societal structures and provides a
common feature that permeates societies. With most OECD countries facing
aging populations, age-based analysis allows for a greater degree of
generalisability. In particular, analyzing the dynamics of income groups
depends on the selection and definition of these groups, leading to
considerable variation in the results. Conversely, age groups can be
clearly delineated by certain cut-off points (30/35/40) and our research
confirms the robustness of the results across these
groups.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Despite its relevance and potential, research
focusing on age groups remains unduly scarce. My study contributes to
this research gap by highlighting two salient aspects. First, I argue
that the demand for substantive representation among young voters is far
from being met. This conclusion is based on our finding that shifts in
government spending are significantly less in line with the preferences
of younger citizens than their older counterparts. Furthermore, this
research introduces a comprehensive approach that incorporates dynamic
and group representation mechanisms. My findings highlight that current
assemblies do not adequately address issues relevant to young adults,
regardless of their electoral incentives. Thus, the interplay between
group representation and dynamic representation theories provides
fertile ground for insights into the determinants of political
responsiveness in different policy contexts.</p>
<p>Both theories are consistent in explaining the decline in government
spending despite an increase in young adults’ preferences for government
spending, but they highlight different aspects of the gap between young
adults’ preferences and policy outcomes. Politicians, fundamentally
driven by electoral behavior <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-strom1990">Strøm 1990</a>; <a href="#ref-anderson1999">Anderson 1999</a>)</span>, often have no
choice but need to disregard groups that refrain from voting, such as
young adults. At the same time, a political system with a predominant
focus on short-term policy outcomes fails to adequately address the
long-term perspectives and interests of young adults. This mismatch can
potentially lead to a sense of political alienation among young adults,
thereby creating a self-reinforcing cycle in which politicians cater
primarily to groups that exhibit robust political participation.
Furthermore, young MPs change their stance over the course of their
political careers in order to adapt to the prevailing political process.
This tendency can lead to a mismatch between young adults’ preferences
and actual policy outcomes. Furthermore, it is argued that young
politicians cannot adequately represent their contemporaries due to a
lack of skills or systemic barriers within parliaments <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bailer2021a">Bailer et al. 2021</a>)</span>.
It’s important to note, however, that empirical evidence suggests that
young adults behave differently from their older counterparts and are
more likely to represent the interests of their age group <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-alesina2018">Alesina, Cassidy, and Troiano 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-mcclean2021">McClean 2021</a>)</span>. Despite this tendency, the number of young MPs remains
disproportionately low <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stockemer2018">Stockemer and Sundström 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-stockemer2022">Stockemer and Sundstrom 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Even when the preferences of young adults are known to older
parliamentarians, a lack of understanding or empathy for these
preferences contributes to a lack of representation in policy outcomes.
This problem is exacerbated by the shift in young adults’ values towards
relational equality and their increased demand for representation,
elements that are not reflected in the belief systems of the majority of
parliamentarians. As a result, the interests of young adults are often
not adequately considered by critical actors <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-childs2012">Childs and Webb 2012</a>)</span>, underlining
the urgency of strengthening descriptive representation. In order to
determine whether a shift to long-term perspectives or an increase in
descriptive representation would be more beneficial, I examined
differences across issue domains. My results suggest that the domain of
political issues can significantly influence the degree of political
responsiveness. Both theories posited reduced responsiveness in areas of
long-term importance to young adults, a prediction that our data
confirmed. Politicians show strong responsiveness to issues of
importance to the median voter, regardless of the time horizon of these
issues. This could be attributed to a greater alignment of interests
between the median voter and the typical policymaker in terms of
age-related relevance and preferences. Such a trend implies an increased
importance of group representation. In addition, policymakers generally
show a bias towards short-term issues with immediate benefits. However,
our results suggest that this bias may be a less important driver than
initially thought. For example, while it is one element of the overall
landscape, it does not overshadow the importance of other influencing
factors, in particular the need for greater group representation among
young adults.</p>
<p>The analysis was further deepened by examining the responsiveness of
politicians to different age groups, with a particular focus on young
adults. The responsiveness of politicians to the electorate often
depends on political participation. In particular, low voter turnout
among young people is a problem in this regard <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lawless2015">Lawless and Fox 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-shames2017">Shames 2017</a>)</span>. This trend has led to claims that legislators lack
incentives to address the interests of the younger demographic. Young
politicians are also often seen as potentially inadequate
representatives of their contemporaries due to skill deficits or
systemic obstacles within parliamentary structures. Moreover, those
young politicians who do manage to overcome these barriers often find
themselves having to realign their strategies with the older median
voter in order to secure re-election. This paradigm suggests that an
actor seeking re-election has little choice but to neglect groups that
refrain from voting. This dynamic contributes to the low substantive
representation of young adults and other demographic groups
characterized by low turnout and places some responsibility for this
state of affairs on these groups themselves. However, the findings
challenge this paradigm. We can see a pronounced negative responsiveness
to issue areas of significant relevance to young adults. On the other
hand, short-term effects seem to have a negligible impact on
politicians’ responsiveness to young voters. This finding contradicts
the hypothesis that politicians are primarily responsive to the
interests of groups with high voter turnout, and provides evidence for
the importance of group representation factors.</p>
<p>Thus, my findings suggest that vote-seeking strategies are not the
primary determinant of politicians’ considerations. Instead, shared
characteristics emerge as a more powerful driver. This conclusion
underscores the importance of group representation in shaping policy
outcomes and challenges the narrative that low turnout among young
adults is primarily to blame for underrepresentation. While this
contributes to our understanding of the representation of young adults
and the underlying drivers of substantive representation, it is
important to acknowledge certain limitations. My study relies on
expenditure data because of their extensive coverage in most OECD
countries over a significant period of time. These data could easily be
matched with preferences for changes in spending in corresponding
expenditure areas. However, this type of data is known to be vulnerable
to not fully capturing the relationship between preferences and policy
outcomes. To minimize this limitation, I have extensively discussed
whether we can expect a substantial relationship, and have kept only
those questions where this assumption is plausible. In particular, there
is a large body of research supporting this relationship for social
spending, but less evidence for areas such as defense, environmental
protection, and public safety. Nevertheless, it is difficult to prove
these relationships through statistical tests, so our results depend on
these assumptions.</p>
<p>I have chosen to compare changes in the share of GDP because, by using
changes in expenditure, it has been possible to differentiate out most
of the predictors of expenditure. However, various factors specific to
particular countries, issues, or years could influence the rate of
change in spending. In order to identify common effects and thus gain
substantial knowledge, I have used country-issue and year fixed effects.
Caution must be exercised with regard to common errors. To avoid bias, I
controlled for economic growth to neutralize the effect of changes in
GDP when spending changes as a percentage of GDP, while accounting for
common economic shocks during the study period. I also controlled for
government ideology as a proxy for past voter preferences, while leaving
the effects of term in office uncontrolled due to their importance in
our analysis. While I am not aware of any other factors that might
influence changes in government spending over time and thereby affect
public preferences across countries and issues, it is crucial to
recognize that in the real world, there are many potential covariates
that have not been considered.</p>
<p>In my analysis of issue areas, I categorized them according to their
group relevance and time horizon. Despite striving for straightforward
conceptualization and basing our categorization on solid argumentative
grounds, the process remains to some extent arbitrary and carries the
risk of selection bias. This risk is exacerbated by the relative lack of
comprehensive research on specific issues. Nevertheless, I argue that
the findings regarding the relevance of issues to young adults are
robust. The category was formulated on the basis of strong theoretical
arguments based on ideological shifts and self-interest considerations.
Concerning time horizons, I conceptualized short- and long-term not
based on the typical, but on the potential character of an issue area.
This approach enhances objectivity and comparability across contexts.
While I am confident that this approach reflects significant aspects of
real-world behavior, the finding of the low importance of the time
dimension is heavily dependent on these allocations. Hence, I advocate
for further critical investigation of this issue. An additional
limitation of this study is that, despite the use of spending data,
there are only a limited number of observations per issue area. Of the
total 314 observations, which include all necessary variables, they span
seven issue areas, typically containing 40 to 50 observations each.
Thus, the statistical findings concerning different issue areas must be
interpreted with caution. While this certainly constitutes a limitation,
it further amplifies the explanatory power of the significant findings,
thereby reinforcing my arguments.</p>
<p>Despite the inherent limitations, my findings on the low level of
substantive representation among young voters are highly significant. By
integrating both dynamic and group representation mechanisms, I propose
a comprehensive approach that allows for further exploration of my
finding - the high dependency on group representation. This exploration
is particularly relevant given ongoing demographic shifts that predict
an increase in the dependency ratio in favor of the young. Economic
welfare and social transfers will increasingly rely on younger
populations. At the same time, a noted shift in young adults’ beliefs
towards immaterial values and relational equality is increasing the
demand for representation of this group, a trend that I expect to grow
in the future. My findings underscore the urgency of mechanisms to
address these numerical representation gaps and ensure adequate
representation in legislative assemblies. Systemic barriers to this
progress need to be identified and addressed. Furthermore, it is
incumbent upon older policy-makers to promote sensitivity to the demands
for equal consideration of the interests of all age groups. This would
serve to avoid implicit ideological conflicts and pave the way for a
more inclusive democratic system that effectively responds to the
diverse needs of its citizens. The research presented here provides a
substantial basis from which such progress can be pursued.</p>
